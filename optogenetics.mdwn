# A) Recent overviews or reviews for optogenetics for freely moving / freely behaving animals

* **Wireless optogenetics hardware** (compact survey): *Wireless Devices for Optical Brain Stimulation: A Review of Current Developments for Optogenetic Applications in Freely Moving Mice* (Cellular & Molecular Bioengineering, 2024/25 e-collection). Focuses on wireless powering, comms, device classes, trade-offs for unconstrained behavior. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39949492/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Patterned light in behaving mice**: *Recent advances in light-patterned optogenetic photostimulation in freely moving mice* (Neurophotonics, 2024). Covers head-mounted optics, near single-cell patterning on the move, road map for next steps. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38404422/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Tetherless optical neuromodulation** (orange-red → NIR/MIR): Review of red-shifted opsins, upconversion nanoparticle-mediated approaches, and photothermal routes enabling less-tethered experiments in vivo. Great for understanding behavior-compatible wavelengths and trade-offs. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11306867/)
* **Integrated bioelectronics + optogenetics for brain–body circuits** (perspective with behaving-animal emphasis): *Integrated Bioelectronic and Optogenetic Methods to Study Brain–Body Circuits* (ACS Nano, 2024). Summarizes ultrapotent/red-shifted opsins and wireless μLED systems used in freely behaving animals. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11544702/)
* Optical delivery tech that pairs well with free behavior: Review of optical fiber technologies for optogenetics, including flexible/biodegradable interfaces that reduce tethers and bulk.

# B) Optogenetic stimulation across in vitro and in vivo (broad reviews)

* **Comprehensive primer across cells -> organisms**: *Optogenetics for light control of biological systems* (Nat Rev Methods Primers, 2022). Covers actuators (ion channels, GPCRs, cyclases), targeting, illumination strategies (1p/2p, holography), applications from cultures/slices to behaving animals. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10627578/)
* **Biophysics & opsin fundamentals**: *Optogenetic control of neural activity: the biophysics of microbial rhodopsins in neuroscience* (Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics, 2024). Excellent for mechanism-level understanding that informs both in vitro and in vivo stimulation design. [Cambridge University Press & Assessment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quarterly-reviews-of-biophysics/article/optogenetic-control-of-neural-activity-the-biophysics-of-microbial-rhodopsins-in-neuroscience/6F9E422992D9418D9418B5F5B5DC5178?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Neurophotonics landscape (control + readout): *Neurophotonics: a comprehensive review, current challenges, and future trends* (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024). Broad survey including optogenetic stimulation modalities and how they integrate with optical recording—useful for planning full experiments. [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2024.1382341/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Practical experimental design for behavior**: *Theoretical Considerations for Optimizing the Use of Optogenetics with Complex Behavior* (Current Protocols, 2023). Not a device review—rather, a clear guide to designing stimulation paradigms that translate from slices/cultures to behaving tasks. [Current Protocols](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.836?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Application-focused review: *Toward Optogenetic Hearing Restoration* (Annual Review of Neuroscience, 2024). Domain-specific, but an excellent model for translating opsins + light delivery from bench to in vivo function. [Annual Reviews](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-neuro-070623-103247?crawler=true&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Besides using optogenetics to stimulate cells or neurons, you can also use GFP and other techniques to get data out of cells, such as genetically encoded voltage indicators (which are an alternative to various fluorescent dyes). See [Voltron2: Sensitivity optimization of a rhodopsin-based genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicator](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627323002052).
