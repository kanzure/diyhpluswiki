Though massive in size, it binds to carbohydrate receptors on the cell membrane and forces it to undergo endocytosis, enclosing the toxin inside a vesicle. Typically such endosomes have lowered pH to degrade their contents, tcdB however undergoes a conformational change at low pH. The toxin forms a pore in the membrane of the endosome, then releases its payload into the cytosol. In nature, this consists of a lethal glucosyltransferase domain (6). By rendering this region atoxic by mutating catalytic residues, tcdB is rendered nontoxic and becomes a potential vehicle for crossing the cell membrane. Atoxic C. diff toxin B (atcdB) has demonstrated the ability to transport a small alkyltransferase protein across the cell membrane, which was connected to the former position of the glucosyltransferase domain with a glycine-serine linker and successfully released into the cell (7)."

* [magnetosome-based protein purification using Spytag and Spycatcher and Mms13 protein](http://2016.igem.org/Team:NEFU_China/Descriptiona) "Our team developed a novel protein purification approach that eliminates most weaknesses of other techniques. Our method is based on the highly specific recognition and covalent conjugation between Spytag (a peptide with 13 amino acids) and Spycatcher (a peptide with 116 amino acids). We also take the advantage of a magnetic bacterium AMB-1 that can produce magnet particles, also called Magnetosome, covered by a bilayer phospholipid membrane, in which Mms13 protein is anchored. We generate Spycatcher-Mms13 and express this fusion protein in AMB-1 bacteria to make Spycatcher linked to the Magnetosome. A protein of interest with a Spytag at its N- or C-terminus is expressed in E. coli and present in bacterial lysate. The Spycatcher-Mms13-linked Magnetosome can specifically and covalently conjugate to the Spytag-tagged protein in the bacterial lysate and they can be simply co-purified by a magnet. Due to covalent linkage, stringent washing can be used to achieve high purity of the recombinant protein that is subsequently released by cleavage of a designated protease."

# DNA synthesis

One of the largest bottlenecks is DNA synthesis. Achieving $1/genome or lower costs of DNA synthesis would allow for many more projects. It seems unlikely that $1/genome or lower can be achieved with phosphoramidite synthesis.

Here are some related projects:

## concepts

Some of these were originally from [this email](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/enzymaticsynthesis/34_BjNj6wsQ).

* electronic control of polymerase
* nucleotide gun made out of a nanotube pointed at the finger domain of some DNA polymerase
* single-polymerase water droplet & add in a single dNTP at a time
* physical display of dNTP as template for current base addition (i.e., on a stick) (not a protein template)
* a protein that can undergo conformational changes that polymerase thinks represents the template strand
* pull/push a template through DNA polymerase to control which dNTP it should be selecting for
* protein-template DNA polymerase, where the polymerase itself has a giant protein that enzymatically encodes dNTP information (protein template, like in CCA-adding enzymes)
* mechanical pressure on polymerase
* some magical ultrasound method
* replacing parts of traditional phosphoramidite synthesis with enzymes until the entire process is enzymatic
* [using multiple telomerase enzymes](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/enzymaticsynthesis/6GZT8zFNOfo) that you wash away after each step
* [light-dependent RNA tolermase](http://sphere.chronosempire.org.uk/~HEx/tmp/prop.pdf) also see [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/enzymaticsynthesis/6GZT8zFNOfo)

* [enzymatic-mediated stepwise protein synthesis without DNA and without RNA](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/enzymaticsynthesis/3YEEv0OULo0/zJZPETWDbMIJ)
* focus on [tRNA synthetases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoacyl_tRNA_synthetase) as a method of enzymatic control over protein synthesis, then work backwards to DNA synthesis eventually

# Proteins

Here are some interesting proteins worth making in the event that you are able to make large proteins.

green fluorescent protein (GFP). These are especially useful for testing whether or not synthesis worked. Also, other [biological pigments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Biological_pigments).

[chromoproteins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromoprotein), like hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochromes and flavoproteins.

blood clotting factor for hemophiliacs (see "Molecular approaches for improved clotting factors for hemophilia")

[Enzymatic conversion of blood types, removal of blood type antigens](http://2014.igem.org/Team:Tuebingen)

[Various photoreceptors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_protein), including [ultraviolet photoreceptors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UVR8).

gelatin

Whatever protein makes magnetosomes in magnetotactic bacteria (maybe MamK).

MagA - for producing magnetic nanoparticles

[type three secretion system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_three_secretion_system) is an "injectisome". "Structures similar to Type3SS injectisomes have been proposed to rivet gram negative bacterial outer and inner membranes to help release outer membrane vesicles targeted to deliver bacterial secretions to eukaryotic host or other target cells in vivo."

[kinesin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesin) is a motor protein that drags cargo along microfilaments.

[titin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titin) is a molecular spring used in human muscle, 3-4 nm in diameter and 1 micron long. See [here](http://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Titin_Structure_%26_Function).

[hemoglobin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin), for oxygen transport.

"DAF-2 is an insulin receptor protein in worms and it has a similar function in humans. Worms without these proteins live twice as long as worms that have them." Maybe something that blocks DAF-2 receptors.

ATP synthase: a molecular rotor that synthesizes ATP. See video [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI8m6o0gXDY).

antibodies (maybe) (they have some other structure not including amino acids)

Akt1 - smooth muscle hypertrophy?

[Various proteopathies may be fixable with protein synthesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteopathy#List_of_proteopathies)

[apoptosome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosome) - has an interesting shape

[ferritin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin) - stores and releases iron

[transferrin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin) - iron-binding blood plasma glycoproteins that control the level of free iron in biological fluids

phytosystems and chlorophyll - light-reactive

rhodopsin

chromophores

antifreeze proteins

enzymes/proteins useful for natural competence

enzymes needed for induced pluripotency in stem cells

luciferase

biotin

insect pheromones

channelrhodopsin - "Among the microbial opsins which can be used to investigate the function of neural systems are the channelrhodopsins (ChR2, ChR1, VChR1, and SFOs) to excite neurons. For silencing, halorhodopsin (NpHR),[23] enhanced halorhodopsins (eNpHR2.0 and eNpHR3.0),[24] archaerhodopsin (Arch), Leptosphaeria maculans fungal opsins (Mac), and enhanced bacteriorhodopsin (eBR) have been employed to inhibit neurons (see Figure 2), including in freely-moving mammals.[25]" see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics>

functionalized bioplastics (like with gfp?)

various [heat shock proteins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock_protein)

[allophycocyanin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophycocyanin) - "Allophycocyanin (APC) is an intensely bright phycobiliprotein isolated from red algae that exhibits far-red fluorescence with high quantum yields. It is excited by laser lines at 594 and 633 nm, with an absorbance maximum at 650 nm and a fluorescence emission peak at 660 nm."

[stomata-closing proteins in plants](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3M71)

## theoretical proteins that would be nice to have

DNA capture compartment -- a giant organelle-like structure that absorbs and stores arbitrary dna it finds from the environment. Ideally, it would give some visual indication once it has absorbed at least one DNA molecule. Also, an RNA equivalent would be useful. It would be particularly useful if this sort of enzyme could be used prior to cleaning up ancient fossils (in case there really is DNA left around).

molecular lego with proteins based on binding affinity between lock and key domains, synthesize distinct proteins that lock together to form larger shapes and structures at the molecular level (molecular nanotechnology)

connectome sequencing (for brain scanning, brain uploading, synapse-level neuroanatomy, etc.)

<div id="igem-project-ideas" />
# Future iGEM project ideas

After reading all iGEM projects, here are some ideas for interesting future iGEM projects to pursue.

* Surface display techniques: by introducing better and more varied surface display techniques, it becomes easier to do directed evolution and selection projects to optimize enzyme activity. Methods can be developed to focus on cleaving surface linkers, reversible surface linking, flagellar display (on the flagella itself), aptamer display and antibody display on surfaces, etc.

* Directed evolution techniques focusing on secretion, surface display, exosomes, bacterial microcompartments, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), etc.

* TdT (terminal deoxyterminal transferase): Various enhancements to de novo DNA synthesis could be had by further investigation into TdT and other weird polymerases See <http://2014.igem.org/Team:Cooper_Union/TdT_project> and <http://2015.igem.org/Team:Cooper_Union/DeNovoSynthesis> for more details. In particular, there might be interesting directions to engineer mutant TdT enzymes, chimeric TdT enzymes, characterization of TdT activity, etc.

* polymerases: In general, de novo DNA synthesis from polymerases would be highly useful in synthetic biology. "Weird properties" in polymerases, such as azobenzene amino acids to control polymerase, could be further explored.

* Fusion proteins based on cas9 and recombinases for further genome editing techniques

* Better than Gibson assembly? Characterization of homologous recombination pathways in ecoli and other bacteria. Optimization of homologous recombination from single pot many short 100mers. See <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/enzymaticsynthesis/uyZqtJO24RE/lApLb4JmCAAJ> for related ideas.

* Genome sequencing of Rana sylvaticus (a frog): what are the antifreeze proteins and adaptations? Can these be used in other organisms?

* Control and variation of morphological shape of microorganisms

* embed DNA polymerase (or other DNA synthesizing molecules) in cell membranes such that DNA gets released immediately, do selection on length of produced DNA from these cells

* DNA barcoding --- such as for lineage tracing, connectome sequencing, etc. Could probably get interesting results with recombinases and Cas9.

* cryotoxin-resistant cells for various cryopreservation reagents (use directed selection techniques)

* Human circadian rhythm sensor -- use dyes and pigments to report on human circadian clock status from urine samples or other samples

* Directed evolution co-selection cultures -- use multiple bacteria to participate in selection by signalling and attacking underperforming cells in nearby media

* More DNA assembly techniques: we can make 100mers but how do we make entire genomes from small fragments?

* Simple demonstration of optogenetic stimulation to store information in a cell, and recombinases to load/read information from genetic memory to cause an optical response (probably coloration, dyes, etc). Could use signalling molecules to trigger the storage of information over time. DNA barcoding and DNA import through a pore could also be used to refer to specific regions of memory to elicit specific pre-programmed responses.

* Simplified continuous directed evolution techniques (mRNA display is somewhat annoying at the bench)

* magnetosome protein purification technique + cell-free freeze-dried protein transcription system and synthetic gene networks on paper -- could make for an interesting way to do protein production entirely without cells. Yields might still favor cell culture, though.

* protein lego bricks -- binding by DNA addresses or other high affinity ligand specific techniques, for a stable toolbox of known protein structures and shapes and building up larger structures from small parts.
