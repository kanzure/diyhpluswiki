<https://www.lygenesis.com/> "organ transplantation by using the patient's own lymph nodes as bioreactors to grow functioning ectopic organs [...] one donated liver can treat dozens of ESLD patients, and the cell therapy is engrafted into the lymph nodes using an outpatient endoscopic ultrasound procedure. [...] hepatocytes (liver cells) transplanted into lymph nodes organize and begin to function as miniature ectopic livers."
