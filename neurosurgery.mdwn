they put humpty dumpty back together wrong <https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2017.00072/full> "A 15-year-old boy, with traumatic avulsion of nerve roots C5–C7 and a non-rupture of C8–T1, was operated 3 weeks after the injury with nerve transfers: (a) terminal part of the accessory nerve to the suprascapular nerve, (b) the second and third intercostal nerves to the axillary nerve, and (c) the fourth to sixth intercostal nerves to the musculocutaneous nerve. A second operation—free contralateral gracilis muscle transfer directly innervated by the phrenic nerve—was done after 2 years due to insufficient recovery of the biceps muscle function. One year later, electromyography showed activation of the biceps muscle essentially with coughing through the intercostal nerves, and of the transferred gracilis muscle by deep breathing through the phrenic nerve."

bilateral anterior cranulotomy shows an increase of 5 to 10 IQ points in severe cases of obsessive compulsive disorder. However, to my knowledge this surgical IQ intervention has not been tested in non-OCD individuals.
