Development of short sleeper phenotype after [[brain surgery|neurosurgery]]: [Development of a short sleeper phenotype after third ventriculostomy in a patient with ependymal cysts](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3899325/) -- "Beyond presumably lowered overall supratentorial brain pressure, thalamic and hypothalamic structures near the intervention site might be responsible for the changed regulation of sleep homeostasis and circadian regulation. Due to their exposed location and the proximity to the third ventricle, decompression of the wake-promoting histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus might be involved or alternatively altered expression of genes regulating circadian rhythm and sleep homeostasis."

[The evolution of sleep is inevitable](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00293)

"Being awake day and night forces an organism to adapt to both light and dark, as well as to the different organisms populating each, and to do so would compromise its ability to perform well in either. ... Pick one, either day or night, and optimize your structure, function and behavior for that environment, then get away from the one you did not choose, to avoid attempting to optimize to both... In the adaptive theory, we hide from the danger of darkness; in this new theory we hide from the danger of adapting to the darkness on evolutionary timescales." from <https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7120898/>

[Systemic and nasal delivery of orexin-a (hypocretin-1) reduces the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance in nonhuman primates](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/27/52/14239) -- "Hypocretin-1 (orexin-A) was administered to sleep-deprived (30–36 h) rhesus monkeys immediately preceding testing on a multi-image delayed match-to-sample (DMS) short-term memory task. The DMS task used multiple delays and stimulus images and effectively measures cognitive defects produced by sleep deprivation (Porrino et al., 2005). Two methods of administration of orexin-A were tested, intravenous injections (2.5–10.0 μg/kg, i.v.) and a novel method developed for nasal delivery via an atomizer spray mist to the nostrils (dose estimated 1.0 μg/kg). Results showed that orexin-A delivered via the intravenous and nasal routes significantly improved performance in sleep-deprived monkeys; however, the nasal delivery method was significantly more effective than the highest dose (10 μg/kg) of intravenous orexin-A tested. The improvement in performance by orexin-A was specific to trials classified as high versus low cognitive load as determined by performance difficulty under normal testing conditions. Except for the maximum intravenous dose (10 μg/kg), neither delivery method affected task performance in alert non-sleep-deprived animals. The improved performance in sleep-deprived animals was accompanied by orexin-A related alterations in local cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglc) in specific brain regions shown previously to be engaged by the task and impaired by sleep deprivation (Porrino et al., 2005). Consistent with the differential effects on performance, nasal delivered orexin-A produced a more pronounced reversal of sleep deprivation induced changes in brain metabolic activity (CMRglc) than intravenous orexin-A. These findings provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of intranasal orexin-A in alleviating cognitive deficits produced by loss of sleep."

orexin receptor agonists are currently the subject of several clinical trials as a treatment for narcolepsy. Here are some [self-reports from the orexin receptor agonist clinical trial participants](https://old.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1lzz8g0/tak861_phase_3_results/).

intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of [orexin-A increases wakefulness](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC384801/) in narcoleptic mice. There are various orexin receptor agonists such as takeda's oveporextin, suntinorexton, firazorexton, alixorexton, etc. "What about [automatic orexin peptide administration](https://isaak.net/sleepless/) in sync with your personal circadian rhythm (think of insulin pumps)?"


There have also been [[cell therapy]] studies using orexin cell transplants into mouse or rat brain, showing increased wakefulness after cell treatment.


from Wikipedia: "[Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_sleep) (especially deep SWS and REM) is tricky behavior because it steeply increases predation risk. This means that, for sleep to have evolved, the functions of sleep should have provided a substantial advantage over the risk it entails. ... According to Tsoukalas (2012), REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex. This reflex, also known as animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as the last line of defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal: the animal appears dead (cf. "playing possum"). The neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction show striking similarities to REM sleep, a fact which betrays a deep evolutionary kinship. For example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, sympathetic activation, and thermoregulatory changes."



selectively breed mice for anti-sleep mice: longer wakefulness, shorter sleep, less sleep deprivation. We can also selectively breed brain colonizing microbes that reduce the total amount of necessary sleep, and recover from postmortem brains to retrieve the microbes that cause a greater sleepless effect and undergo selection that way.

Sleep deprivation does not itself cause death, multiple days of sleeplessness have not been fatal in humans.

Modulating duration of wakefulness vs duration of sleep (short sleep). Can sleep deprivation be made to be less painful?
