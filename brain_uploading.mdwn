It seems likely that brain uploading will occur via [[in situ sequencing]] methods like [[fisseq]] combined with [[expansion microscopy]]. Also axonal tracing via [[lineage tracing]] techniques or other connectome data extraction. If we need even greater detail recovered from human brain, then possibly [[DNA nanoscopy]] could be used.

[[DNA ticker tape]] memory devices and intracellular protein ticker tape memory devices are also of high relevance to the question of brain uploading.

See [[fisseq]] for information about brain uploading.

See [[human brain reverse engineering]] for some other ideas.

# Brain uploading companies

<https://eon.systems/> is focusing on human brain emulation. Nectome is focused on human brain preservation in [[cryonics]]. E11 Bio is focused on synaptic barcoding and connectome DNA sequencing. There was also the startup venture (Brain Backups) doing microCT (high-resolution x-ray computed tomography) of gold aptamer conjugates for targeting synapses or receptors and then doing regular imaging.
