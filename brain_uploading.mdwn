It seems likely that brain uploading will occur via [[in-situ-sequencing]] methods like [[fisseq]] combined with [[expansion microscopy]]. Also axonal tracing via [[lineage tracing]] techniques or other connectome data extraction. If we need even greater detail recovered from human brain, then possibly [[DNA nanoscopy]] could be used.

See [[fisseq]] for information about brain uploading.

See [[human brain reverse engineering]] for some other ideas.
