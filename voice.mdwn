Whisper is pretty good for speech-to-text.

Groq Whisper is very fast and cheap. I think up to 8 hours per day is still free through their API?

[aider](https://aider.chat/) has a `/voice` command.

[voice.sh](https://gist.github.com/kanzure/27d165dcaba026600304355e02d46e97), a fork of aider's voice command made for the terminal.

[youtube-text.sh](https://gist.github.com/kanzure/593da089044814bb9c189d3c369e44d4)

.vimrc configuration for voice command:

```
nnoremap glv :r !voice.sh 2>&1 \|
            \ tee /dev/tty \|
            \ sed '/^Recording, press ENTER to send to Groq when done/d' \|
            \ sed 's/[[:space:]]//'<CR>
```


Summon a terminal and just speak
