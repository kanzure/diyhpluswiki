mitochondria injection <https://www.mitrix.bio/> "In these tests, “young” highly functional mitochondria are grown in prototype bioreactors and transfused into the bloodstream. Cells absorb them to help supplement old, dysfunctional mitochondria and reverse energetic decline. These tests showed apparent age reversal in multiple endpoints in animal disease models in-vivo and human cells in-vitro."

random facts that may be important for health:

- cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) is 20% of the inner membrane
- cardiolipin is composed of 18:2 in SAD americans and other livestock, but 22:6 is [preferentially utilized](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/13/11/15447 "Dietary Docosahexaenoic Acid (22:6) Incorporates into Cardiolipin at the Expense of Linoleic Acid (18:2): Analysis and Potential Implications")
  - conjugated linoleic acid (trans omega-6) increases apoptotic signaling, perhaps by changing its composition. cancer protection
- lipid peroxidation can increase proton leak rate and reduce efficiency
- solanine (green potato and tomato) opens permeability transition pore, increasing leak rate
- mitochondrial leak test by inhibiting ATP synthase (oligomycin) and measuring oxidative activity
- PINK1/PARKIN control mitophagy
- Thyroid hormone (T3) increases mitochondrial biogenesis, raises expression of oxidative phosphorylation proteins and uncoupling proteins
- [bezafibrate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7059007/ "Metabolic effects of bezafibrate in mitochondrial disease") and other PPAR agonists, AICAR an AMPK activator (not ALCAR), and compounds that activate PGC‑1α indirectly (exercise, sirtuin activators like nicotinamide riboside / NMN for NAD+ boosting) can increase mitochondrial biogenesis
