mitochondria injection <https://www.mitrix.bio/> "In these tests, “young” highly functional mitochondria are grown in prototype bioreactors and transfused into the bloodstream. Cells absorb them to help supplement old, dysfunctional mitochondria and reverse energetic decline. These tests showed apparent age reversal in multiple endpoints in animal disease models in-vivo and human cells in-vitro."

# mitochondrial transfer

including spontaneous intercellular mitochondrial transfer.

[Mitochondrial transfer/transplantation: an emerging therapeutic approach for multiple diseases](https://cellandbioscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13578-022-00805-7) -- ".. Intercellular mitochondrial transfer can occur through tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs), extracellular vesicles (EVs) (such as cell-secreted nanobodies including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies), and gap junction channels (GJCs)." This article has some good references for each phenomenon.

can mitochondrion be transferred via contractile injection systems? what about mitochondrion transfer via trogocytosis? possibly requires membrane-bound mitochondrion.

possibly other mitochondrion transfer techniques include cell fusion, fusogens, cell-cell fusion, neurite fusion, axon fusion, dendrite fusion, various membranous bridges, conjugative pilus, .... Some of these can probably be programmed via [[cell-specific targeting]] as a form of [[cell therapy]] for cell-targeted mitochondrial injection.

## Program or enhance TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer

* Miro1 (Rho-GTPase)
  *Ahmad et al., EMBO J (2014).* Overexpressing Miro1 in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) markedly increases intercellular mitochondrial transfer (largely via TNTs) and improves rescue efficacy in injury models; Miro1 knockdown impairs it. [EMBO Press](https://www.embopress.org/doi/10.1002/embj.201386030?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  *Babenko et al., (2018).* Extends this: Miro1-high donor cells donate mitochondria more efficiently and improve recovery after experimental stroke. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6017474/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  *Reviews cementing the mechanism and its use in MSCs/epithelium:* Las & Shirihai (2014) and later syntheses. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4193928/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Building more “highways” with M-Sec/TNFAIP2.
  *M-Sec discovery/mechanism.* M-Sec (TNFAIP2) induces TNTs in cooperation with RalA and the exocyst; N-terminal polybasic region binds PIP2 to localize at the plasma membrane during TNT initiation. Overexpression increases TNTs; depletion reduces them. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2918763/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep33548?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  *Functional outcome.* In podocytes, M-Sec–dependent TNTs are required for mitochondrial transfer; knockout/knockdown diminishes transfer and exacerbates injury. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8259684/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* A recent “platform” example in immunotherapy.
  *Baldwin et al., Cell (2024).* Bone-marrow stromal cells form nanotubes to CD8⁺ T cells and deliver mitochondria, boosting T-cell metabolic fitness and antitumor efficacy, and positioning TNT-mediated donation as an engineerable therapeutic modality. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39276774/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Cell](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900956-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Dialing transfer up/down by cytoskeletal regulators.
  Down-regulating MICAL2PV (an actin/methionine oxidase splice variant) increases TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer; the splice form normally suppresses TNT formation. [EMBO Press](https://www.embopress.org/doi/10.15252/embr.202052006?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## How to localize/bind mitochondria to TNTs

Key idea: TNTs are mostly F-actin–based (some thicker ones also contain microtubules). To bias mitochondria into TNTs, you attach motors/adaptors on mitochondria that bind actin or microtubules, and/or you enrich TNT-forming proteins at the membrane.

* Actin-based coupling (into classic thin TNTs):
  • Myo19 is an OMM-associated myosin that processively transports mitochondria on actin—a direct mechanical link to F-actin inside TNTs. (Great for “loading” mito onto actin tracks.) [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9065997/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  • Miro1/2 recruit Myo19 to mitochondria; Miro proteins are bona fide OMM receptors coordinating actin- and microtubule-based mitochondrial movement. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30111583/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  • Spire1C (mitoSPIRE1) anchors to mitochondria and nucleates actin on the OMM—strengthening mito–actin contacts that favor entry/retention in actin-rich TNTs. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4574297/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26305500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  • Myo10 (unconventional myosin X) promotes TNT formation; boosting Myo10 increases TNT occurrence and vesicle/organelle transport within them (useful for “making more tracks”). [The Company of Biologists](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/126/19/4424/53824/Myo10-is-a-key-regulator-of-TNT-formation-in?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5474251/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Microtubule-based coupling (useful in thicker TNTs that contain MTs):
  • TRAK1/2 adaptors + KIF5 (kinesin-1) link mitochondria to microtubules. TRAK1 enhances KIF5B processivity, enabling long-range mito transport—relevant for wider, MT-containing TNTs. [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16972-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  • Direct evidence that mitochondria ride microtubules inside intercellular nanotubes exists in cell models, supporting the MT-coupling route when tube caliber allows. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5833423/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* Programmable/tunable tethers you can adapt for TNTs (toolbox papers):
  • Chemically inducible dimerization (CID) lets you tether mitochondria to chosen structures on demand (rapamycin FKBP–FRB; also split-FRB variants). Prior work shows inducible ER–mitochondria and PM–mitochondria contacts using TOM20-FRB + organelle- or membrane-anchored FKBP—a template you could adapt by fusing FKBP to a TNT-enriched protein (e.g., M-Sec or Myo10) to bias mitochondria into TNTs. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2860863/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  • ActuAtor (Listeria-inspired) recruits an actin-polymerizing module to user-defined membranes (including mitochondria via TOM20 tags) upon rapamycin, generating local actin forces—handy for “pushing” mitochondria along actin-rich protrusions like TNTs. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872831/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.016360.full?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### biological mitochondrial transfer techniques

* To program donors to donate more mitochondria through TNTs: Overexpress Miro1 in donor MSCs or stromal cells; consider co-boosting M-Sec or Myo10 in the network-forming cell type to increase TNT density. [EMBO Press](https://www.embopress.org/doi/10.1002/embj.201386030?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep33548?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The Company of Biologists](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/126/19/4424/53824/Myo10-is-a-key-regulator-of-TNT-formation-in?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* To bias mitochondria into TNTs and keep them there: Enrich Miro1/2–Myo19 on the OMM (for F-actin TNTs) and/or Miro–TRAK–KIF5 (for MT-containing TNTs). [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30111583/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9065997/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16972-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* To test direct “binding/localization” strategies: Use CID with TOM20-FRB on mitochondria and FKBP-M-Sec or FKBP-Myo10 at TNT membranes to inducibly dock mitochondria to TNTs; verify by live imaging of Mitotracker/PAgfp-mito and line-scan intensity along TNTs. (This leverages established CID organelle-tethering systems.) [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2860863/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Separately, mitochondria can be transferred via direct injection.

# intramitochondrial parasitism

also there is at least one [intramitochondrial endosymbiont](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39758-x) called "Midichloria mitochondrii" and it resides in the mitochondria of hard tick (Ixodes ricinus) oocytes.
