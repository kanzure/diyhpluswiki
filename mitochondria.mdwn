# Mitochondria

mitochondria injection <https://www.mitrix.bio/> "In these tests, “young” highly functional mitochondria are grown in prototype bioreactors and transfused into the bloodstream. Cells absorb them to help supplement old, dysfunctional mitochondria and reverse energetic decline. These tests showed apparent age reversal in multiple endpoints in animal disease models in-vivo and human cells in-vitro."
