# Microfluidics projects overview #

low-cost and open source microfluidic chip for DNA synthesis and probably DNA sequencing, thermocycling, cell culture, transgenics/electroporation, bubble logic, etc.

## Strategy ##

probably 2-layer PDMS with pressure valves

## Equipment ##

* mini laser cutter (1 micron beam width, approx. 1 micron step size)
* dust fan for cutting fumes
* syringe pumps
* spin coater
