# Microbial nootropics

See a discussion of microbial nootropics at <http://gnusha.org/logs/2015-06-22.log> for more details.

## Directed evolution of brain microbes to engineer a nootropic

Intracortical or intracellular parasites should be developed for intelligence enhancement. This could be done through genetic engineering, rational design, machine learning, and directed evolution and selection via bacterial populations in mammalian brains after colonization in brain and psychometric testing for the test function. There were some notes about using neuronal intracellular parasites (like toxoplasma) from the [[hplusroadmap]] IRC logs back in 2017 or earlier if you want to go looking for that.

brain parasites (or perhaps intracellular parasites, there are even [[mitochondrial|mitochondria]] parasites)

plasmids with BDNF and other neural growth factors

lots of mutagenesis

Selection methods and targets:

* Maze solving: infect mice, run mice through mazes, evaluate maze solving performance, recover bacteria from the brains of mice that perform well.

* Hippocampus size: infect mice, wait some time, evaluate hippocampus size, recover bacteria from mice that have larger-than-average hippocampus

* Sleep: infect mice, observe sleep behavior and patterns, select for microbes that decrease total mouse sleep requirements or decrease the negative effects of sleep deprivation

Besides bacteria, postmortem brains also show evidence of fungi.

## Gut microbiome engineering and selection

"Smarty Stools": it may be possible to develop a microbial nootropic confined entirely to the gut using fecal matter donation from high brain growth human infants, [interspecies intestinal microbial development](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23692-w), doing multiple rounds of selection based on fetal brain development trajectory or neonatal brain development, followed by eventually returning for treatment in human. Both maternal gut microbial content should be altered (for fetal brain development modulation), as well as newborn gut microbe content (for ongoing brain development).

* gut microbiome and its influence on adult brain function, behavior, or learning
