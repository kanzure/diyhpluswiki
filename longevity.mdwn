# Longevity

The field of longevity and anti-aging has interest in slowing the aging process and completely rejuvenating the human body through engineered negligible senesence. Many different kinds of interventions are considered, including organ transplantation, xenotransplantation, [[cell therapy]], [[gene therapy|gene-therapy]], [[human germline genetic engineering|genetic-modifications]], surgical interventions, pharmaceutical drugs, antibodies, drugs, nutrition, etc. Aging is a disease that should be solved.

## Definitions

**Anti-Aging:** Interventions that prevent or slow the accumulation of damage or the rate of metabolic decline (e.g., caloric restriction or caloric restriction mimetics). These extend healthspan and potentially maximum lifespan but do not reverse the biological clock.

**Rejuvenation:** Interventions that actively reverse age-related damage, restore youthful gene expression profiles (epigenetic resetting), or replace lost tissue (stem cell therapies), effectively reversing the biological age of the organism.

## Genetic interventions

See [[germline modifications page|genetic-modifications]] for substantially more information about proposed germline genetic modifications for longevity, rejuvenation, anti-aging, longer lifespan, etc.

[Growth hormone receptor gene disruption in mature‐adult mice improves male insulin sensitivity and extends female lifespan](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8672790/) -- Ghr^flox/flox^ mice + tamoxifen-inducible Cre-Lox, activated at 6 months. Robust GH resistance, reduced IGF-1, and increased median and maximal lifespan in females.

[Inducible knockdown of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A gene expression in adult female mice extends life span](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5506424/) (2017) -- Floxed Pappa allele (PAPP-A = pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, an IGF-binding-protein protease), using tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase. PAPP-A normally cleaves certain IGF-binding proteins, increasing local IGF bioavailability. Knocking it down reduces IGF signaling; genetically long-lived mice with low GH/IGF signaling (Ames, Snell, GHRKO etc.) show similar phenotypes, and PAPP-A KO has been recognized as a "GH/IGF-pathway" longevity model.

## Adult somatic gene therapy

See [[gene therapy|gene-therapy]] for more information about gene therapy techniques.

## Aging damage types

Interventions are often categorized by which "hallmark" or damage type they address.

*  **Genomic Instability:** Accumulation of nuclear DNA damage. Future interventions may involve "industrial strength" repair enzymes (e.g., CIRBP from Bowhead whales) or [[DNA damage repair]] upregulation (SIRT6).
*  **Epigenetic Alterations:** Loss of histone acetylation and DNA methylation patterns. This is the target of **partial reprogramming** via Yamanaka factors (OSK).
*  **Loss of Proteostasis:** Accumulation of misfolded proteins (e.g., amyloid, tau) and failure of autophagy/lysosomal degradation.
*  **Mitochondrial Dysfunction:** Decline in ATP production and mitonuclear communication (NAD+/pseudohypoxia).
*  **Cellular Senescence:** Accumulation of "zombie cells" that secrete inflammatory factors (SASP).
*  **Stem Cell Exhaustion:** Depletion of regenerative pools.
*  **Altered Intercellular Communication:** "Inflammaging" and chronic systemic inflammation.
*  **Extracellular Matrix Stiffening:** Accumulation of cross-links (e.g., glucosepane) leading to tissue rigidity (e.g., arteriosclerosis).

## Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS)

Proposed by Aubrey de Grey, SENS is a damage-repair paradigm arguing that metabolism is too complex to tweak safely; instead, we should repair the damage metabolism causes. The SENS approach categorizes aging into seven types of damage:

1.  **Intracellular Junk:** (e.g., Lipofuscin). *Solution:* LysoSENS (microbial enzymes to degrade waste).
2.  **Extracellular Junk:** (e.g., Amyloid). *Solution:* AmyloSENS (immunotherapy/antibodies to remove aggregates).
3.  **Extracellular Crosslinks:** (e.g., AGEs). *Solution:* GlycoSENS (enzymes to break crosslinks).
4.  **Cell Loss:** (e.g., Sarcopenia, neurodegeneration). *Solution:* ReplenSENS (stem cells/tissue engineering).
5.  **Death-Resistant Cells:** (e.g., Senescent cells). *Solution:* ApoptoSENS (senolytics).
6.  **Mitochondrial Mutations:** (mtDNA deletions). *Solution:* MitoSENS (**Allotopic Expression**—moving mitochondrial genes into the safety of the nucleus).
7.  **Nuclear Epimutations:** (Cancer risk). *Solution:* OncoSENS (WILT—removing telomerase machinery and reseeding stem cells).

## Nutritional and Metabolic Interventions

### Caloric Restriction (CR) and Mimetics

Calorie restriction is the most robust intervention for lifespan extension in model organisms. It works by downregulating nutrient-sensing pathways (IIS/mTOR) and upregulating maintenance pathways (AMPK/Sirtuins).

*   **Rapamycin:** An mTOR inhibitor that mimics the effects of CR. It is the gold standard for pharmacological lifespan extension in mice.
*   **Metformin:** Activates AMPK and induces a mild energetic stress that upregulates defense mechanisms.
*   **NAD+ Precursors:** (NR, NMN) aimed at restoring levels of NAD+, a critical co-enzyme for Sirtuins that declines with age.

### Longevity Vitamins and Triage Theory

Bruce Ames' Triage Theory suggests that the body rations micronutrients (vitamins/minerals) for immediate survival at the expense of long-term repair. Chronic sub-clinical deficiencies lead to "insidious damage" (e.g., DNA breaks).

*   **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline quinone):** Stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis.
*   **Ergothioneine:** A potent antioxidant transporter.
*   **Taurine:** Decline leads to aging; supplementation extends life in mice.
*   **Glycine:** Not just a structural amino acid, but an epigenetic regulator capable of restoring mitochondrial respiration in aged fibroblasts.

### Bioavailability and Feedback Loops

Many potential geroprotectors (e.g., **Curcumin**, **Resveratrol**, **Quercetin**) suffer from poor bioavailability. Furthermore, biological feedback loops often dampen the effect of single-agent interventions.

*   **The Inflammaging Loop:** The NLRP3 inflammasome activates NF-κB, which produces cytokines that further prime the inflammasome.
*   **The Mitonuclear Loop:** Declining NAD+ leads to pseudohypoxia (HIF-1α stabilization), which disrupts nuclear-mitochondrial communication, further reducing NAD+.

## Senolytics

Senolytics are a class of therapeutic agents that selectively induce apoptosis in senescent cells, where senescent cells are defined as cells that have permanently exited the cell‑cycle yet remain metabolically active and secrete a pro‑inflammatory cocktail known as the senescence‑associated secretory phenotype (SASP). By clearing these dysfunctional cells, senolytics reduce chronic low‑grade inflammation, restore tissue homeostasis, and improve the function of stem‑cell niches, thereby slowing or mitigating the progression of age‑related physiological decline. Unlike rejuvenation strategies that aim to reverse or "reset" aged tissues, senolytic interventions work within an anti‑aging framework that seeks to preserve existing tissue integrity and extend healthspan by removing a key driver of molecular and cellular damage.

## Supplementation

* centrophenoxine
* selegiline (deprenyl)
* epitalon
* metformin
* resveratrol
* rapamycin
* combination of thiamine, nicotinamide, pyridoxamine, piperine, and alpha-lipoic acid designed to reduce appetite and advanced glycation end products
* l-arginine
* cocoa megadosing
* plasma dilution, young blood rejuvenation, blood letting
* fasting mimicking diet, prolon therapy

## Theories of aging

**Antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging** predicts that alleles conferring developmental fitness become liabilities in post-reproductive life. ([ref](https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2018/1/287/5126836)). The antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging predicts that alleles conferring developmental fitness become liabilities in post-reproductive life, and the empirical evidence reviewed here strongly supports conditional late-life deactivation of the GH-IGF-1-insulin axis (IGF1R, GHR, GHRH), the mTORC1-S6K1 anabolic cascade, the proliferative transcription factor Myc, the NAD+-depleting ectoenzyme CD38, the pro-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic cytokine IL-11, the senescence-promoting histone acetyltransferase KAT7, the ROS-amplifying adaptor p66Shc, the angiotensin receptor AT1A, the translation-optimizing rRNA methyltransferase NSUN5, adipose-specific insulin receptor signaling, and—with careful dose control—mitochondrial Complex I activity. These pathways share a common pattern: they promote growth, proliferation, and rapid protein synthesis during development when selection pressure is maximal, but their continued activity in aging drives cancer, fibrosis, metabolic dysfunction, senescence accumulation, and oxidative damage. Implementation requires age-gated genetic architectures—whether through inducible degrons, senescence-responsive promoters (e.g., SASP cytokine-activated), telomere-length sensors, or systemic activator administration—that preserve early-life pathway function while enabling late-life suppression, thereby capturing longevity benefits without developmental cost.

The "**free radical theory of aging** is largely considered defunct or heavily modified. Systemic antioxidant supplementation generally fails to extend life because ROS are signals activating essential repair pathways. Naked Mole Rats, for example, live 30+ years despite having *higher* levels of oxidative damage than short-lived mice, suggesting that **damage tolerance** and proteostasis are more critical than oxidative damage prevention.

**Disposable soma** theory of aging

**Damage accumulation** theory of aging, including damage to maintenance/repair/resilience mechanisms.

## Whole body transplantation

Whole body transplantation or human head transplantation to a [[human clone|cloning]] seems more likely to work in the short-term with less investment compared to other longevity science. The remaining problem is an aging brain, although the natural limits of brain aging (absent the confounders of other systemic aging in the body) are not presently known. It also varies between people: some people lose a lot of brain mass or experience central neurodegeneration while others do not experience dementia or other brain deterioration with aging.

There are several startup companies pursuing whole body transplantation at this time. I think 2 or 3 companies, like R3. See [[cloning]] for more information.

See also "bicephalic head transplantation" where you don't have to murder the clone or figure out how to grow (or maintain) anencephalic human clones.

## Directed evolution for extreme longevity

The best way to gain longevity is to have a selective pressure for longevity, such as through long-term [[selective breeding|directed evolution]] of human families for extreme longevity. The main problem with this approach is not that it will not work, but that it will take a very long time.

However, some longevity progress (using selection and mutation) can be achieved in human cell culture in the interim. For example, simulate high oxidation damage scenarios and select for resistance to oxidative damage.

## Advocacy against "fairweather-only" longevity research

Solving longevity and anti-aging might take an exceptionally long time, both for adult therapy but also for human embryo engineering. It may take 300 more years of molecular biology research. In general we should do this work anyway, even if we (the current living adults that are aging) do not directly benefit from this.

**Normal function:** Relaxation of torsional stress via transient SSB (3′-phosphotyrosyl covalent intermediate)

**Trapping agents:** Camptothecin and derivatives (topotecan, irinotecan), endogenous oxidized bases, ribonucleotides, abasic sites

**Consequence:** Replication fork collision converts TOP1cc to irreversible DSB

**Repair:** TDP1 hydrolyzes 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond; alternative: endonuclease cleavage (XPF-ERCC1) removes oligonucleotide with attached TOP1

#### Topoisomerase II-DNA Cleavage Complexes (TOP2cc)

**Normal function:** Passage of DNA duplex through transient DSB (5′-phosphotyrosyl covalent intermediates on both strands)

**Trapping agents:** Etoposide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, teniposide

**Consequence:** Persistent DSB with protein-blocked termini

**Repair:** TDP2 hydrolyzes 5′-phosphotyrosyl bond; alternative: MRN-CtIP endonucleolytic processing; NHEJ or HR for DSB

### Epigenetic and Modified Base Damage

#### TET-Mediated Oxidation Products of 5-Methylcytosine

**Pathway:** 5-methylcytosine (5mC) → 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) → 5-formylcytosine (5fC) → 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) via TET dioxygenase iterative oxidation

**Dual nature:** Physiological intermediates in active DNA demethylation; potentially mutagenic if bypassed during replication

**Mutagenicity:** 5fC read ambiguously by some polymerases (C or T incorporation)

**Repair/removal:** Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) excises 5fC and 5caC, initiating BER and restoration of unmodified cytosine

#### Aberrant Cytosine Modifications

**Sources:** AID/APOBEC off-target activity, environmental mutagens, spontaneous deamination of modified bases

**Lesions:** 5-chlorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-hydroxycytosine, 5-hydroxyuracil

**Repair:** TDG, SMUG1, MBD4 glycosylases (overlapping specificities)

### Nucleotide Pool Damage and Incorporation

#### Oxidized Nucleotide Incorporation

**Source:** Oxidation of dNTP pool (8-oxo-dGTP, 2-OH-dATP)

**Mechanism:** Oxidized dNTPs escape polymerase discrimination, incorporate opposite wrong template base

**Sanitization:** MTH1 (NUDT1) hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGMP, preventing incorporation; NUDT15, NUDT5 for other damaged nucleotides

**Consequence if incorporated:** G:C→T:A or A:T→C:G transversions

#### Base and Nucleoside Analog Incorporation

**Sources:** Chemotherapeutic agents (5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, cytarabine, fludarabine), antiviral nucleosides, BrdU (experimental)

**Mechanisms:**
- **Chain termination:** 3′-modified sugars (araC, acyclovir) block extension
- **Fraudulent bases:** 5-FU mispairs, causes futile BER cycling; BrdU photosensitizes, increases fragility
- **dNTP pool disruption:** Thymidylate synthase inhibition (5-FU, methotrexate) causes dUTP accumulation and incorporation

### Transposon and Mobile Element-Induced Damage

#### Retrotransposon Activity (LINE-1)

**Mechanism:** LINE-1 ORF2p endonuclease creates nick at target site, ORF2p reverse transcriptase synthesizes cDNA using cleaved 3′-OH as primer (target-primed reverse transcription)

**Consequences:**
- Target site DSB formation
- Insertional mutagenesis
- Genome instability from ectopic recombination between dispersed elements
- Aberrant DNA structures (inversions, deletions, duplications)

**Regulation:** Silenced by DNA methylation, piRNA pathway, APOBEC3 restriction; reactivated in cancer and aging

#### Endogenous Retrovirus Reactivation

**Source:** HERV elements derepressed by hypomethylation (cancer, aging, cellular stress)

**Consequences:** Similar to LINE-1; additionally may produce viral proteins with immunogenic or oncogenic properties

### Viral-Induced DNA Damage

#### Integrating Virus Damage

**Examples:** Retroviruses (HIV, HTLV-1), HBV (via integration of double-stranded DNA intermediate)

**Mechanism:** Integrase-mediated strand transfer creates DSBs flanking provirus, repaired by host NHEJ (often with errors)

**Consequences:**
- Insertional mutagenesis (oncogene activation, tumor suppressor disruption)
- Genomic instability from multiple integrations
- Persistent DSB signaling

#### Non-Integrating Virus Damage

**Mechanisms:**
- Viral protein-mediated replication stress (HPV E6/E7 deregulating cell cycle, increasing origin firing)
- ROS/RNS induction (EBV LMP1, HCV)
- Degradation of DNA damage response proteins (HPV E6-p53, E7-Rb)

### Biogenic and Metabolic Adducts (Miscellaneous)

#### Catecholamine and Neurotransmitter Adducts

**Sources:** Oxidation of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin by various oxidases and transition metals

**Mechanism:** Quinone formation followed by Michael addition to nucleophilic centers on nucleobases

**Lesions:** N²-dG and N⁶-dA adducts of catechol quinones

**Relevance:** Potential contribution to neurodegeneration, repaired by NER and AlkB dioxygenases

#### Polyamine-Derived Adducts

**Sources:** Spermine/spermidine oxidation by polyamine oxidases, producing aminoaldehydes

**Mechanism:** Schiff base formation with dG exocyclic amino group

**Lesions:** N²-(aminopropyl)-dG, N²-(aminobutyl)-dG

#### Vitamin and Cofactor-Derived Adducts

**Examples:** Retinaldehyde-dA adducts, biotin-dA adducts (holocarboxylase synthetase-mediated)

**Significance:** Generally minor, context-dependent pathological relevance

### Physical and Mechanical Damage

#### Torsional Stress-Induced Damage

**Source:** Replication fork progression, transcription bubble movement, chromatin remodeling

**Consequences:** Positive supercoiling ahead of forks/bubbles induces topoisomerase activity; failure to resolve leads to DNA breaks, R-loop formation, and illegitimate recombination

#### Mechanical Shearing

**Source:** Mitotic chromosome condensation/segregation errors, nuclear envelope rupture during migration through confined spaces

**Consequences:** DSBs, chromosome fragmentation, chromothripsis
