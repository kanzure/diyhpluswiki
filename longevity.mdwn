# Longevity

## Genetic interventions

See [[germline modifications page|genetic-modifications]] for information about proposed germline genetic modifications for longevity, rejuvenation, anti-aging, longer lifespan, etc.

## TODO

* adult somatic gene therapy interventions
* drug therapy for longevity, rejuvenation, etc
* [[cell therapy]]
* [[gene therapy|gene-therapy]]
* eunuch
* an overview of major research institutions and ventures pursuing longevity (NewLimit, Altos, Calico Life Sciences, Retro biosciences, Insilico Medicine, Methuselah Foundation, SENS Research Foundation except it was recently renamed and I don't remember the new name, ..)

## Whole body transplantation

Whole body transplantation or human head transplantation to a [[human clone|cloning]] seems more likely to work in the short-term with less investment compared to other longevity science. The remaining problem is an aging brain, although the natural limits of brain aging (absent the confounders of other systemic aging in the body) are not presently known. It also varies between people: some people lose a lot of brain mass or experience central neurodegeneration while others do not experience dementia or other brain deterioration with aging.

There are several startup companies pursuing whole body transplantation at this time. I think 2 or 3 companies.
