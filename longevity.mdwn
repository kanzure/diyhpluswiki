# Longevity

The field of longevity and anti-aging has interest in slowing the aging process and completely rejuvenating the human body through engineered negligible senesence. Many different kinds of interventions are considered, including organ transplantation, xenotransplantation, [[cell therapy]], [[gene therapy|gene-therapy]], [[human germline genetic engineering|genetic-modifications]], surgical interventions, pharmaceutical drugs, antibodies, drugs, nutrition, etc. Aging is a disease that should be solved.

## Genetic interventions

See [[germline modifications page|genetic-modifications]] for substantially more information about proposed germline genetic modifications for longevity, rejuvenation, anti-aging, longer lifespan, etc.

[Growth hormone receptor gene disruption in mature‐adult mice improves male insulin sensitivity and extends female lifespan](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8672790/) -- Ghr^flox/flox^ mice + tamoxifen-inducible Cre-Lox, activated at 6 months. Robust GH resistance, reduced IGF-1, and increased median and maximal lifespan in females.

[Inducible knockdown of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A gene expression in adult female mice extends life span](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5506424/) (2017) -- Floxed Pappa allele (PAPP-A = pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, an IGF-binding-protein protease), using tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase. PAPP-A normally cleaves certain IGF-binding proteins, increasing local IGF bioavailability. Knocking it down reduces IGF signaling; genetically long-lived mice with low GH/IGF signaling (Ames, Snell, GHRKO etc.) show similar phenotypes, and PAPP-A KO has been recognized as a "GH/IGF-pathway" longevity model.

## Whole body transplantation

Whole body transplantation or human head transplantation to a [[human clone|cloning]] seems more likely to work in the short-term with less investment compared to other longevity science. The remaining problem is an aging brain, although the natural limits of brain aging (absent the confounders of other systemic aging in the body) are not presently known. It also varies between people: some people lose a lot of brain mass or experience central neurodegeneration while others do not experience dementia or other brain deterioration with aging.

There are several startup companies pursuing whole body transplantation at this time. I think 2 or 3 companies, like R3. See [[cloning]] for more information.

See also "bicephalic head transplantation" where you don't have to murder the clone or figure out how to grow (or maintain) anencephalic human clones.

## Advocacy against "fairweather-only" longevity research

Solving longevity and anti-aging might take an exceptionally long time, both for adult therapy but also for human embryo engineering. It may take 300 more years of molecular biology research. In general we should do this work anyway, even if we (the current living adults that are aging) do not directly benefit from this.
