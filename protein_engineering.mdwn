This is a wish list for protein folding and engineering.

[[!toc levels=5 ]]

# Wishlist

This wishlist contains some speculation and brain storming and shouldn't be considered completely viable for now.

* Given a 3d shape (of some nanostructure), produce a protein's amino acid sequence that will consistently create that shape. (done as of 2023?)

* Control over protein functional properties, such as catalytic domains and sites, as well as designing specific confirmational changes and control over conformation changes.

* [[DNA data storage]]: faster polymerases

* Proteins that make molecular display techniques easier (simplifying lab bench protocols) -- like mRNA display and ribosome display; easier molecular display would be very valuable for projects using directed evolution techniques.

* Better protein-based **nanopores** for [[DNA sequencing]], amino acid sequencing, and protein sensing.

* Human-controlled DNA polymerase synthesis activity (choose each nucleotide), or an instrumented ribosome to control protein production regardless of mRNA content

* Molecular **protein lego**: connect multiple legos together to build large-scale protein structures. This is generally useful for modeling and nanostructures. Binding by DNA addresses or other high affinity ligand specific techniques, for a stable toolbox of known protein structures and shapes and building up larger structures from small parts.

* Protein **mechanical logic**: protein structures that have internal logic and state, based on mechanical motion or other catalytic reactions and interactions.

* Generalized, **fully-programmable [[molecular nanotechnology]]**: programmable nanomachines and nanofactories that can produce other nanostructures to exact specifications, without uncertainty regarding protein folding.

# TODO

* What were those long-tube protein molecular-chemistry factories called? These were non-ribosomal peptide synthetases or NRPS. They are apparently natural, and they have multiple points of interest inside the tube that modify a molecule as it progresses along the protein.

* more Baker lab references

## 7. Other techniques to consider

| Technique | Core Insight | Practical Implementation |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Deep Mutational Scanning** | Generates quantitative, position‑specific enrichment landscapes for folding, binding, catalysis, and cellular fitness without prior structural knowledge. | Synthesize codon‑substituted libraries (including insertions/deletions), select under relevant conditions, NGS pre‑/post‑selection, compute enrichment scores. |
| **Ribosome Display & mRNA Display** | Enables selection from libraries limited only by synthetic DNA diversity, compatible with stringent or proteolytic conditions. | In‑vitro translation of ribosome‑arrested or puromycin‑tethered mRNA–protein fusions, affinity capture, RT‑PCR recovery, iterative rounds. |
| **Thermodynamic Integration & Free‑Energy Perturbation** | Alchemical MD protocols that mutate ligand atoms into dummy or alternate atoms, integrating ∂H/∂λ to yield absolute or relative binding free energies within chemical accuracy. | Use enhanced‑sampling Hamiltonian replicas, accurate force fields, convergence diagnostics. |
| **Kinematic Closure (KIC)** | Solves protein loop closure analytically, enabling rapid enumeration of sterically allowed conformations that can be refined by rotamer repacking and energy minimization. | Apply to loop modeling in Rosetta or other modeling suites, integrate with MD for side‑chain optimization. |
| **Native Chemical Ligation** | Chemoselectively condenses an unprotected synthetic peptide bearing a C‑terminal thioester with another peptide containing an N‑terminal cysteine to form a native amide bond, enabling total chemical synthesis of proteins with precise labels. Size limited to small-to-medium sized proteins (<200 aa), or larger targets via iterative ligations or post-folding fusions. | Synthesize peptide fragments, perform ligation under mildly acidic conditions, purify product, verify by MS. |
| **Cystine‑Knot (Knottist) Engineering** | Cross‑braces a short β‑sheet or helical core with three disulfides that weave a topological knot, imparting extreme proteolytic, thermal, and chemical stability while allowing hypervariable loops for recognition. | Design cystine‑knots in silico, express in systems that support disulfide formation, test stability. |
| **Mirror‑Image Phage Display** | Screen an L-peptide library against the synthetic D-enantiomer of the target; the corresponding D-peptide of the selected binder is then synthesized to recognize the native L-target. |
| **Algorithmic T‑Cell Epitope Mapping** | Scans protein sequences for peptide epitopes whose length matches the anchor preferences for common MHC class II alleles, then redesigns surface residues to eliminate motifs while preserving structure and activity. | Use epitope prediction tools, apply conservative mutations, validate by immunogenicity assays. |
| **Trinucleotide Mutagenesis** | Uses pre‑synthesized phosphoramidite trimers corresponding to desired codons to build combinatorial libraries that exclude stop codons and allow user‑defined amino‑acid ratios at each diversified position. | Design oligonucleotide pool, perform PCR, transform, screen. |
| **Hydrocarbon Stapling** | Installs an all‑hydrocarbon cross‑link across two non‑natural α‑methyl,α‑alkenyl amino acids incorporated at positions separated by one helical turn or an integer multiple thereof of an α‑helix via ring‑closing metathesis, locking the helix in its bioactive conformation and conferring protease resistance and enhanced cell penetration. | Synthesize stapled peptide, characterize helicity (CD), test functional activity. |
| **Hydrogen–Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX‑MS)** | Monitors time‑dependent deuterium incorporation into backbone amides as a readout of solvent accessibility and hydrogen‑bond stability; peptic digestion and high‑resolution LC‑MS/MS localize exchanged sites, enabling time-resolved conformational dynamics, allosteric pathways, and binding interfaces. | Perform HDX experiment, analyze MS data, map to structure. |
| **Deep‑Learning Hallucination & Inpainting** | Seeds a generative protein network with random noise or partial backbone coordinates, then iteratively optimizes a latent space under structural and functional constraints so that the network hallucinates complete protein backbones that cradle desired catalytic or binding motifs without relying on known folds. | Use models like ProteinMPNN, Diffusion‑based generators, enforce constraints, validate by synthesis. |
| **Fragment‑Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) Applied to Protein Active‑Site Inhibition** | Identifies low‑molecular‑weight chemical fragments that bind subsites of the catalytic pocket with millimolar‑to‑micromolar affinity; structure‑guided linking or growing merges these fragments into larger ligands whose enthalpically favorable, vector‑directed interactions achieve nanomolar potency while maintaining ligand efficiency and selectivity. | Screen fragment library, co‑crystallize, design linkers, synthesize, assay. |

## 8. Summary Recommendations for Practitioners

1. **Separate designability from expressibility** – a protein may be easy to redesign but hard to produce in a given host.
2. **Leverage structural data** (X‑ray, cryo‑EM, AlphaFold) to identify *tolerant* regions for mutation and *critical* residues for active‑site redesign.
3. **Combine rational design with directed evolution** – use computational predictions to narrow library size, then apply phage/yeast display, PACE, or CFPS for high‑throughput screening.
4. **Consider allosteric sites** in addition to active sites; engineered allosteric modulators can provide tighter control and lower off‑target effects.
5. **Employ modular scaffolds** (repeat proteins, SpyTag/SpyCatcher, nanobodies) to create synthetic assemblies without destabilizing individual domains.
6. **Use non‑canonical amino acids** for site‑specific labeling, cross‑linking, or to introduce photo‑responsive elements (azobenzene).
7. **Validate folding and function** with biophysical assays (CD, NMR, SAXS, MD) before moving to cellular or organismal contexts.
8. **Iterate**: design → expression → characterization → feedback to model → redesign.
