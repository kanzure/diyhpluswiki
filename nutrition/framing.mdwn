# Nutrition

## Background

Real-world computational systems trained via gradient descent expend
costly/limited substrate on predictive models of the following:

1) the distribution of inputs they're trained on, and
2) the gradient descent function itself (or "meta-objective")

A means of minimizing zero-sum tradeoffs in the quality of these predictive
models that would otherwise have to compete with eachother for computational
resources is to unify them via a system of heuristic sub-goals specific to the
training distribution (or "mesa-objective").

[The relationship between the meta-objective and the mesa-objective becomes
increasingly undefined and emergently antagonistic the further away from the
training distribution of inputs the computational system finds itself executing
on.][Evan Hubinger et al arXiv:1906.01820] ([video][Robert Miles

## How does this relate to nutrition?

Evolution has an (emergent) meta-objective of "maximize genomic/proteomic
replication" that it uses to train the computational systems of
genomics/proteomics via the (stochastic) gradient descent system of mutation
and differential survival. Genomes/proteomes have developed mesa-objectives
that are conducive to the organization and protection of resources needed to
achieve replication **within the training distribution of their evolutionary
history**.

## Problem statement

The relationship between "replication maximization" and "the organization and
protection of resources needed to achieve replication" has become increasingly
antagonistic as the human genome/proteome execution environment has drifted
relative to its evolutionary training environment.

This mesa-misalignment is the primary cause of death today and will only get
worse as the emergent meta-objective of "maximize genomic/proteomic
replication" gets switched out from under humanity for the new emergent
meta-objective of "maximize capacity for inductive reasoning".

Mesa-alignment must be conscientiously addressed.

### TODO:

* full list of n essential+prudent nutrients as something like line segment
  attractors in n-dimensional-behavior-space
* dot out sodium direct motivation/sensing/intake/regulation as example of
  robust alignment
* dot out everything else indirect motivation/sensing/intake/regulation via
  glutamate as example of alignment failure
* some list of antinutrients/pathogens to build obstructive manifolds in
  n-dimensional-behavior-space
* think hard about how to manage the anti-inductiveness of
  antinutrients/pathogens in the future
