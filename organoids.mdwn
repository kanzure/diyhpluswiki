See [[biosight]] for more information.

## Olfactory organoids

TODO: combine both taste (GPCR + ion channel receptors) and also olfaction into a single organoid; is there good reason to not do this?

Consider the olfactory perception enhancements from [[genetic-modifications|the proposed human enhancement genetic modifications page]].

## auditory organoids

engineered hair cells

bat, dolphin, mouse, human.

## Cortical organoids and cerebral organoids, xenotransplantation of

Previous studies have shown human neural stem cells incorporate into mouse brain and even produce a learning enhancement effect. In contrast the following studies are larger cell aggregations that are then integrated into mouse or rat brain, rather than free-floating cells.

* [Maturation and circuit integration of transplanted human cortical organoids](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05277-w)
* [Structural and functional integration of human forebrain organoids with the injured adult rat visual system](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36736289/)
* [Human cerebral organoids establish subcortical projections in the mouse brain after transplantation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-020-00910-4)

Maybe patient-derived organoids could be an interesting option here for intelligence enhancement?
