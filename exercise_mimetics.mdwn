# Exercise mimetics

An **exercise pill** (or full **exercise mimetic**) is a pharmacological or nutraceutical agent (such as but not limited to a synthetic drug, a receptor agonist, or a plant‑derived phytochemical) that is designed to reproduce, at least partially, the complex, multisystemic benefits normally conferred by regular physical activity in human. In other words, it seeks to trigger key molecular pathways (e.g., AMPK, PPAR β/δ, REV‑ERBα, ERRs, SIRT‑1, adiponectin signaling) and downstream effects such as enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved insulin sensitivity, anti‑inflammatory signaling, vascular endothelial function, autonomic balance, and the release of "exerkines" (e.g., NO·, VEGF, IL‑6, myokines) that together drive cardiometabolic health. While a true "full" exercise mimetic would need to replicate the integrated, time‑varying stimulus that each exercise bout provides across multiple organs (muscle, heart, vasculature, liver, adipose tissue, brain, and gut microbiota), most current candidates achieve only a subset of these adaptations, acting as exercise‑mimetic agents that can augment or partially substitute for the physiological cascade generated by exercise.

There are many different kinds of exercise in humans. An exercise mimetic would specifically target one type of exercise, it does not seem plausible to get all the benefits of all the different kinds of exercise in a single exercise mimetic intervention (for example: adaptation through exercise to a marathon runner physique but also a bodybuilder weightlifting adaptation, or other physiques that would be mutually exclusive).

"Many exercise-induced adaptations are inherently linked to acute biological stimuli triggered by exertion (e.g., increased arterial shear stress, adrenaline secretion, transient tissue damage in the form of oxidative stress, or acute inflammation). Such stimuli are virtually impossible to reproduce by taking a pill." therefore any exercise mimetic would likely require non-pill physical interventions. For example, temporary pressure changes exterior to the body or via mechanical compression, etc... it's important also to note that isometric exercise seems to produce muscular hypertrophy, e.g. it's not the full lift that matters; maybe still work to be done on understanding molecular basis of exercise results.

## Trainable human physiques

The following has some information about genetics to achieve certain physiques, but really what would be more interesting is more rapid genetic capacity for switching between these phenotypes through simple training. Some of this information is from the [[germline genetic modification proposals|genetic-modifications]] page.

### Max strength

Max strength or mass: Dominated by extreme myofibrillar hypertrophy (very large Type II muscle fibers), high neural drive for maximal motor-unit recruitment, thick connective tissue, and elevated bone mineral density. Muscles are optimized to produce huge force over short durations, relying on phosphocreatine and glycolytic energy rather than oxygen metabolism. Body mass is high because leverage and inertia aid maximal strength output.

* Muscle size: myostatin (GDF8) knockout, follistatin, or muscle‑specific ActRII decoy (e.g., ACVR2B knockout); muscle hyperplasia via myofiber-specific TEAD1 overexpression (drives satellite-cell hyperplasia for more Pax7+ progenitors), missense mutant myostatin (C313Y for hyperplasia without hypertrophy), or beta-catenin (Ctnnb1) activation in progenitors.
* Anabolic signaling: muscle-restricted IGF‑1 (mIGF-1, α-actin, or MCK promoters) to drive the Akt‑mTORC1 axis; conditional muscle AKT1 activation (myr-AKT1) for fiber hypertrophy and higher grip/peak force.
* Protein synthesis: boost myofibrillar protein synthesis; ensure that the enlarged fibers are packed with contractile proteins rather than merely excess sarcoplasm; muscle-restricted S6K1 modulation or rapamycin-informed hypomorphs for balanced mTOR anabolic signaling.
* Fiber identity: expression of PGC‑1α4, a splice variant that up‑regulates IGF‑1 while repressing myostatin; ACTN3 gain-of-function (Arg577 or rs1815739 R allele mimic) to maintain fast-twitch identity and power.
* Fiber composition: try to bias fiber composition toward large, fast‑glycolytic Type IIx/IIb cells via FOXO1/3/4 triple knockout (suppresses atrophy, preserves strength into aging).
* Bone density: raise cortical thickness and bone mineral density via Sost (sclerostin) knockout or systemic sclerostin‑neutralising antibody (romosozumab); LRP5 gain-of-function for extra strong bones; [GPR133/ADGRD1 enhancement for mechanosensitive bone formation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02291-y); intermittent PTH analogues (teriparatide).
* Neural drive: muscle hyperinnervation: muscle GDNF overexpression, LRP4 overexpression (improves NMJ structure/innervation, grip strength), DOK7 overexpression (enlarges NMJs, improves torque/motor function), or high MuSK overexpression (HSA::MuSK transgene for ectopic synapses and extra innervation).
* Anabolic pharmacology: anabolic steroid analogues (testosterone or SARMs such as ostarine) and low‑dose β2‑adrenergic agonists (clenbuterol) synergise with the IGF‑1/mTOR axis, further increasing protein synthesis and satellite‑cell recruitment.
* Energy substrate: creatine monohydrate supplementation to expand intramuscular phosphocreatine stores; muscle creatine kinase (CKM) transgene; high protein diet.
* Sports genotype boosts: ACE D allele (rs4646994), ACTN3 Arg577, AMPD1 Gln12, HIF1A 582Ser, MTHFR rs1801131 C, NOS3 rs2070744 T, PPARG 12Ala.

### Muscular hypertrophy

Muscular hypertrophy: Characterized by both myofibrillar growth and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, meaning fibers grow large but also swell with glycogen, fluid, and enzymatic volume, creating the “round” look. High training volume increases local blood flow and metabolite tolerance. Mitochondrial and cardiovascular adaptations are moderate. Strength rises but is secondary to muscle symmetry and maximal cross-sectional area.

* Myostatin pathway: myostatin knockouts (GDF8), follistatin overexpression, or bimagrumab (activin type II receptor targeting); muscle-specific follistatin (FST) transgenes; ACVR2B muscle-specific knockout.
* Hyperplasia: muscular hyperplasia targets: TEAD1 myofiber-specific overexpression (satellite-cell hyperplasia), Fn14 (Tnfrsf12a) in satellite cells (increases proliferation/self-renewal), Tcf4+ fibroblasts / PDGFRα+ FAPs regulation, or myostatin C313Y missense mutant.
* Anabolic signaling: muscle-restricted IGF1 (α-actin/MCK promoters) for postnatal mass/strength; conditional AKT1 activation for fast glycolytic fiber growth.
* Metabolic support: PEPCK-C muscle overexpression for improved metabolism/endurance synergy with hypertrophy.
* Anabolic pharmacology: anabolic steroids enhance mass with/without exercise; combine with exercise for maximal gains.

### Explosive power or speed

Explosive power or speed: Built around large and highly reactive Type II fast-twitch fibers, maximal motor-unit firing speed, elastic muscle-tendon stiffness, and a nervous system adapted for rapid contraction. Emphasis is on producing maximal force quickly rather than generating peak force overall. Uses phosphocreatine energy systems, creating dense but relatively compact musculature.

* Sports boosts: HGH/IGF1 for power/recovery; PPAR-delta for slow-twitch but adaptable to power via fat metabolism.

### Durability

Durability: Built to maximize tissue resilience and sustained work output under mechanical stress, this physique emphasizes moderate fiber hypertrophy (Type I and IIa), dense connective tissues, elevated bone mineral density, and neuromuscular systems adapted to maintain coordination under fatigue. Aerobic capacity is strong but secondary to the ability to support prolonged load carriage, awkward movements, impact exposure, heat stress, and sleep or calorie restriction. Compared to endurance athletes, durability bodies are metabolically less efficient but mechanically tougher—capable of working for long periods with heavy equipment and structural strain without breakdown, even though they lack elite long-distance speed or maximal oxygen-use efficiency.

### Endurance

Endurance: Built to maximize movement efficiency and sustained oxygen delivery, this physique is defined by extreme mitochondrial density, expansive capillary networks, and dominance of Type I slow-twitch fibers optimized for fatigue resistance at low force output. Cardiovascular adaptations (large stroke volume, high VO₂max) dominate, while muscle size and connective tissue remain minimal to reduce body mass and energy cost. This makes endurance athletes exceptionally efficient for long, unloaded, repetitive movement—but structurally fragile under heavy external loads or impact, with lower bone density, tendon thickness, and joint robustness compared to more load-tolerant physiques.

* Fiber switch: bias fiber composition toward fatigue-resistant Type I slow-twitch fibers via muscle-specific PGC-1α1/β overexpression, calcineurin-NFAT activation (e.g., CnAβ transgene), MEF2C upregulation, or slow myosin heavy chain isoforms (MYH7 overexpression with MYH1/MYH4 suppression); ACTN3 loss-of-function (rs1815739 XX) for endurance bias.

* Longevity for mitochondria: mtDNA copy number increase, allotopic expression (MitoSENS), lower PUFA peroxidation index.

### Strength-to-weight

Strength-to-weight or skill: Optimized for maximal relative strength rather than absolute strength, featuring highly efficient neural activation, dense connective tissues, stiff tendons, and compact musculature with minimal sarcoplasmic bloat. Body fat remains extremely low. Muscles are smaller but capable of producing enormous force per unit of mass due to neuromuscular precision and tendon recoil.

* Fiber bias: bias fiber composition toward compact, high-specific-force Type IIx fibers via ACTN3 R577 gain-of-function (alpha-actinin-3 overexpression), MYH1/MYH4 fast myosin heavy chain promotion, and suppression of slow MYH7 isoforms to maximize force-velocity without sarcoplasmic expansion; ACE D/I balance.

* Skill precision: boost cortical motor neuron excitability and skill precision through BDNF/TrkB signaling enhancement (e.g., muscle-derived BDNF transgene) to enlarge motor cortex representation and refine proprioceptive feedback for relative strength feats.
* Hyperplasia without size: suppress myostatin (MSTN) selectively in fast-twitch progenitors via MYH1 promoter-driven follistatin to enable fiber hyperplasia (more motors) without overall size increase, amplifying force per unit mass; TEAD1 hyperplasia without baseline size increase.
* Proteostasis: muscle proteostasis: TFEB/HSPs for durability under low mass.

### Mixed power-endurance

Mixed power-endurance: Combines moderate muscle hypertrophy with strong aerobic capacity, producing muscles that hold both sizable fibers and high mitochondrial density. Energy systems are highly flexible—both anaerobic power and aerobic endurance are well developed. Lactate clearance and oxidative recovery adaptations are prominent, enabling repeated high-output efforts without extreme specialization.

* Fiber hybridization: balance fiber composition toward glycolytic-oxidative Type IIa intermediates via muscle-specific calcineurin-NFAT (CnAβ/NFATc1) overexpression moderated by AMPKα1 to prevent full Type I conversion, preserving power while enhancing fatigue resistance for repeated efforts; ACTN3 heterozygote mimic.
