This will be a disorganized mess for a bit.

* in vitro fertilization
* embryo, sperm, oocyte/egg cryopreservation
* embryo microinjection (CRISPR, other genetic payloads, etc) (but really should genetically modify upstream cells instead of embryo-stage, or modify embryonic stem cell cultures, etc...)
* intracytoplasmic sperm injection, spermatid injection, (spermatocyte injection?)
* in vitro gametogenesis, spermatogenesis, oogenesis/oocyte production
* embryo splitting (blastocyst bisection, blastomere separation)
* embryo culture media/ATP delivery for infinity embryo splitting
* interspecies blastocyst complementation (<a href="https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1611041947535216640">tweet thread</a>; <a href="https://gnusha.org/logs/2023-01-05.log">logs</a>)
* xenogeneic stem cell transplantation
* organogenic niche method
* interspecies pregnancy, xenogenic embryo, xenotransplantation; co-gestation of interspecies embryos.
* interspecies trophoblast embryo envelopment
* somatic cell nuclear transfer, various [[cloning]] techniques
* somatic cell hybridization, somatic cell haploidization
* somatic cell fusion, other cell electrofusion
* inner cell mass transfer
* Velocimouse technique
* interspecies nuclear transfer, cytoplasm transfer, etc
* gestation using ex vivo uterus (not the same as an artificial womb)
* uterus transplantation (works for human pregnancy), uterus xenotransplantation, uterus development by blastocyst complementation
* ovary follicle transplantation, ovary transplantation (into the arm), ovary cryopreservation
* oocyte in vitro maturation (ooIVM)
* embryonic stem cell extraction and culture, expansion
* "Non-embryo-destructive extraction of pluripotent embryonic stem cells" <https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0035-1558183>
* host/child microchimerism
* germ cell transplantation
* xenografting of testicular tissue pieces for sperm generation
* adult sperm stem cell gene therapy; testis-mediated gene therapy; testis electroporation.
* pronuclear injection
* ooplasm transfer, ooplasm xenotransfer, interspecies ooplasm transfer

* <https://gnusha.org/logs/2023-01-05.log> (interspecies blastocyst complementation)
* <https://gnusha.org/logs/2023-01-21.log> (xy/xx sperm sorting technology)
