# wafers

* MTI <http://www.mtixtl.com/> - Materials science related supplies including wafers up to 6 inch diameter sold in units of one.

* University Wafer <http://www.universitywafer.com/> - Has a wider selection than MTI but minimum orders are high.

* Singapore Optics Shop <http://optics.sg/main.html> - This supplier does not have much of a minimum order (Keep orders above or equal to 5 wafers) but prices can be quite high for small wafers. They do have other wafers like Germanium and also has quite a lot of other cool stuff. They do ship to countries outside Singapore. Price will include SGD $30 handling fee.

* Latech Scientific Supply <http://www.latech.com.sg/> - I am putting them back on here after they have updated their information. They do have a minimum order of 25 pieces for wafers of size 3 inches and above. According to their sales representative, wafers smaller than 3 inches can be bought in small quantities. If you want to get a large amount of wafers, I suggest using Latech as their prices are cheaper than the ones at Singapore Optics Shop. They also have some lab stuff that experimenters might be interested in.
