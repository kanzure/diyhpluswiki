[PMID 11788828], [PMID 15114531] In these populations, the rs4988235(T) allele is both the more common allele and the one associated with lactase persistence; individuals who are rs4988235(C;C) are likely to be lactose intolerant. In populations of sub-Saharan Africans, though, the rs4988235(T) allele is so rare that it's unlikely to be predictive of lactase persistence, and other SNPs are predictive instead.

The image is then rendered to the user as a 360 composite which is squashed to fit the users field of view (or the headset's screen). To avoid unnecessary stitching computation, work out how to cut and stretch the component frames ahead of time. The headset should come with a realign function if the cameras get moved. Your brain should be able to adjust to seeing in 360. Another mod on this is to have the visual input come from cameras on your car, so you can see in 360 of the road around you.

1/22/2013 14:15:44,,NOVEL FUNCTION,Improved transdermal materials,BIOMATERIAL,TRANSDERMALS,"if you line a transdermal device with a collar of protein that skin cells will attach to, then the connection between skin and device should be as strong as normal skin. You would be able to yank on the juncture. Collagen has been suggested, but there are a multitude of extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules up for consideration. Establishing a good transdermal material that will stay attached to the device is a prerequisite for the “requires transdermal components” section. I suggest first testing proteins like collagen and others by implanting something small sideways through a slit in the skin (instead of a window). That way, if there’s a problem, the implant can be removed and the skin can heal.
-how do scientists get skin cells to adhere to glass? what proteins or cell adhesion molecules do they coat the glass with? How do they keep the protein attached?
-try coating a small chip of plexiglass with a collar of this protein and test implant a person with it. If it works, the skin should attach and you should be able to pull on it with the same strength as normal skin.",,Rubix,

The compound needs to be a product favored in high heat where the reactants are favored in low heat.
