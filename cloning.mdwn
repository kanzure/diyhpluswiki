"In 2013, the The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) lifted the ban on cloned horses competing internationally following a review which found they were likely to have any advantage over horses bred traditionally."


"According to the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 42 of its 51 [82%] sniffer dogs were cloned from parent animals as of April, indicating such cloned detection dogs are already making important contributions to the country's quarantine activities. The number of cloned dogs first out-paced their naturally born counterparts in 2014, the agency said. Of the active cloned dogs, 39 are currently deployed at Incheon International Airport, South Korea, the country's main gateway... While the average cost of raising one detection dog is over 100 million won (US$108,816), it is less than half that when utilising cloned puppies, they said."
