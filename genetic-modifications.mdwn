# Human germline genetic engineering, modifications and enhancements

This is a collection of human germline genetic modifications that has been collected over a period of more than 10 years now. It's the largest collection on the internet, and we welcome most contributions. Inquire inside the [[hplusroadmap Discord chat room|hplusroadmap]] for more information.

Please note that many of these candidate mutations need to be re-checked, double checked, and further studied. Be aware that sometimes the statistical power is somewhat lacking, study designs are sometimes bad, and such. Other times, there are very well known mutations that will definitely work. There's no magic short cut other than doing the work and figuring it out. Sometimes a referenced study is actually for mouse or rat, although this doesn't mean the result does or does not translate to human. Another theoretical issue is with regards to multiple simultaneous changes and whether effects can be preserved when making simultaneous changes. Just like there are "off-target" effects in CRISPR, there can be "off-target" effects of protein mutations or modifications that may interfere with natural biology natural function or otherwise interfere with other attempted modifications. In some cases, there might even be an unintended beneficial effect from two or more modified proteins that were modified for different intents but for some reason produce a (possibly unrelated) beneficial effect (or, in many more cases, likely a negative effect). Various problems with GWAS study design and epistemology should be more rigorously identified and reasoned about. Some changes can be experimentally verified in cell models, others may require rodent or primate verification. And finally, sometimes the best way to find out is in human cell culture or human embryo development. There's also a rant about [[polygenics]] available. TODO: outline caveats related to pleitropy, antagonistic pleiotropy, confounding caused by linkage disequilibrium, etc.

# Radiation resistance

CD47 suppression provides gobs of radiation resistance. prevent binding of thrombospondin to CD47 with a drug, inhibits NO production and somehow this prevents radiation damage and kills cancer cells. antisense CD47 RNA should do the trick permanently.

((Add better summary here))

Other radiation resistance: "What about radiation resistance? Here's a case in the literature where radiation resistance was improved 100,000-fold. 10-fold using e14-deletion. 50-fold using recA. 20-fold using yfjK. And 10-fold using dnaB. See Ecoli, Byrne et al, eLife 2014 ("<a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/3/e01322">Evolution of extreme resistance to ionizing radiation via genetic adaptation of DNA repair</a>"). This only requires 4 mutations. There is a wide variation in natural organisms, but the only difference here is those 4 mutations."

# P53 overexpression

As the "guardian of the genome", p53 is missing in many cancers, and has been investigated as a gene therapy option for cancer. Introducing a separate copy, or copies of the gene from the wild-type could reduce the incidence of knockout mutations that normally lead to cancer.

p53 is highly relevant in [[longevity]], see the longevity section later on this page.

Other anti-cancer pathways should be up-regulated and enhanced.

# Lower cardiovascular disease and lower coronary disease

milano allele: "Apolipoprotein A-1 Milano (also ETC-216, now MDCO-216) (ApoA-1 milano) is a naturally occurring mutated variant of the apolipoprotein A1 protein found in human HDL, the lipoprotein particle that carries cholesterol from tissues to the liver and is associated with protection against cardiovascular disease. ApoA1 Milano was first identified by Dr. Cesare Sirtori in Milan, who also demonstrated that its presence significantly reduced cardiovascular disease, even though it caused a reduction in HDL levels and an increase in triglyceride levels."

<a name="PCSK5" />
Those with the PCSK5 gene have 88 percent lower coronary disease.

Also, [PCSK9 loss-of-function](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7447476/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (according to George Church) is also capable of lowering susceptibility to coronary disease and causes lifelong low LDL-C.

## Wild ideas for upgrading the immune system

* [Donor MHC-specific thymus vaccination allows for immunocompatible allotransplantation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-024-01049-5) perhaps possible to encode this into the genome instead. For example, encode and express the complete donor MHC class I and class II regions (or selected classical loci such as H-2Kb, Db, Ab). Restrict expression to thymic epithelial precursors if necessary. Any donor whose MHC class I and II sequences match the ectopically expressed transgenic donor-MHC casette would be tolerated. This could open up acceptance to tissue grafts and organ donation from those donors with matching MHC regions.

* germline encode BCR data for earlier head-start immunity against common antigens. "genomic vaccination"? See [[cell therapy]] for more information about this idea.

* TODO: DRACO for cellular apoptosis instead of leaking interferon everywhere for an immune response. Immediately kills any cell that a virus infects.

* TODO: improved anti-cancer apoptosis stuff

* TODO: downloadable immunity via germline-delivered genetic program to accept lysosome or exosomes carrying antibody fragment plasmids, incorporate into B cells or immune system to generate antibodies based on the given antibody fragment. Use infrastructure outside the human body to develop these antibody fragment plasmids, or find someone who has antibodies for a specific target, then deliver to germline modified humans.

* Cas9 immunity, Cas9 tolerance (be permissive or restrictive about future CRISPR dosages), possibly via dCas9 expression in bone marrow, possibly also want to express deactivated versions of the other CRISPR systems too...

* TODO: make B and T cells more easily reprogrammable in vivo, such as through DREADD targeting or something gating a natural competence pore, or some other technique.

* endogenous cellular CRISPR immune system? nah...

* TODO: reduce acute inflammatory shock like closed airways?

* [transgenic cathelicidin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC549293/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) for protection against Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus; ulcer size reduction. Various cathelicidins from various animals like porcine, crocodile, alligator... Chinese alligator As-CATH8 cathelicidin kills both Gram-positives (S. aureus) and Gram-negatives (A. baumannii, E. coli, Pseudomonas) at lower minimum inhibitory concentration than human LL-37 cathelicidin. Unlike human cathelicidin, As-CATH8 has additional antimicrobial bacterial DNA binding activity. Generally croc cathelicidin is more salt resistant and serum-resistant than human LL-37 cathelicidin. LL-37 should be kept for human wound healing and immune signaling reasons? Some mouse studies have done overexpression of xenobiotic cathelicidin in skin or epithelium. Consider inducible expression of cathelicidin upon infection or inflammation, or restrict expression to non-gut tissue such as respiratory epithelium.

* shark IgNAR single-chain (heavy-chain-only) variable domain is smaller than human antibody multi-chain. Smaller antigens could be detected, and these antibodies might be more heat resistant. Unfortunately to switch to these small antibodies might require substantial genetic changes across the whole immune system including B cells, central and perpheral tolerization, B-cell selection, thymus positive/negative selection would have to be considered.

* "Variable Lymphocyte Receptors" are likely better than human antibody for binding to linear, repetitive, or carbohydrate-rich antigens like glycans, polysaccharides, and repetitive epitopes.

* better defense against bacterial infection via horshoe crab blood cell amebocyte protein "Factor C" (a serine protease zymogen that acts as a bacterial endotoxin sensor). Trace amounts of bacterial lipopolysaccharides bind and activates Factor C, setting off a "proteolytic cascade" which promotes downstream clotting factors like Factor B and proclotting enzyme which converts clotting protein coagulogen into coagulin. Coagulin molecules rapidly polymerize into insoluble strands, creating a gel-like clot. This gel physically traps bacteria and seals off the site of infection or injury. This is a direct enzymatic method compared to the human approach where immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, and monocytes) expressing TL4 pattern recognition receptor detect gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides then triggers upregulation of inflammation, cytokine release, and immune cell recruitment to the infection site. Unclear if coagulin would need to be engineered for human physiological parameters and whether rapid polymerization can still be made to occur in this context. Also enzymatic dissolution of these polymerized clots is something to be considered.

* immunity to HIV, but express a little bit in saliva or different tissues as a venomous defense?

# Digestion

## branching carbohydrates

Alpha-galactosidase expression for the digestion of branching carbohydrates.

Humans are unsuited to digesting some types of branching carbohydrates, which then pass through the intestines and feed annoying bacteria. Not a huge priority, but with the increased metabolic demands from the muscle-enhancing therapies, it can't hurt.

## Lactose tolerance and lactase persistence

<http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs4988235>
<http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs4988235(C;C)>

Also known as "C/T(-13910)", and located in the MCM6 gene but with influence on the lactase LCT gene, rs4988235 is one of two SNPs that is associated with the primary haplotype associated with hypolactasia, more commonly known as lactose intolerance in European Caucasian populations. [PMID 11788828], [PMID 15114531]

In these populations, the rs4988235(T) allele is both the more common allele and the one associated with lactase persistence; individuals who are rs4988235(C;C) are likely to be lactose intolerant. In populations of sub-Saharan Africans, though, the rs4988235(T) allele is so rare that it's unlikely to be predictive of lactase persistence, and other SNPs are predictive instead. [PMID 15106124, PMID 17159977]

## Phytate

Phytic acid or inositol hexaphosphate is a phosphate storage ring used by plants to sequester minerals in seeds. Increased use of phosphate fertilizers has caused overproduction of phytic acid and inadvertently caused mineral nutrients to be locked up in a non-bioavailable form called phytate, making it an anti-nutrient. Degrading the ring releases the minerals so that they can be absorbed, as well as the phosphorus.

## Resistance to weight gain from high-fat diets (APOA5)

<a href="http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs662799">rs662799</a> increases risk of heart attack, but contributes towards preventing weight gain from high fat diets.

body fat distribution SNPs - <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/18/304030">ref</a>

lipodystrophy is a disease where the body cannot store fat properly at all leading to near-total absence of adipose tissue. Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy (extremely low body fat, severe insulin resistance, muscle hypertrophy, heaptomegaly fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia) is associated with mutations in AGPAT12 and BSCL2 (which encodes seipin, which is critical for adipocyte development).

## Destroy chemical toxins

paraoxon is some cholinesterase inhibitor / nerve gas similar to the organophosphate insecticide parathion.

paraoxonase-1 (PON1) degrades paraoxon and other organophosphate pesticides. the PON1-Q variant has higher activity against organophosphates such as sarin.

PON1 also has lipid peroxide degrading activity via hydrolysis. the PON1-R variant has higher activity against lipid peroxides.

PON1 is found on the surface of small lipid transport particles returning their cholesterol to the liver to be reused. these small particles have a high surface area and are exposed to greater lipid peroxidation per unit lipid than on the forward journey when the particle is larger and full of lipids. lipid peroxides likely cause a large variety of diseases of modernity such as heart disease, diabetes, alzheimers, cancer, etc. due to their destructive effects on cell membranes and inflammatory reactions needed to prevent more peroxidation, since it's a chain reaction. fragile and reactive polyunsaturated seed oils are a feature of modern industrial farming and food science, and we should adapt to this fact instead of dying.

PON1 activity is associated with reduced atherosclerosis and heart disease, by blocking the formation of oxHDL and oxLDL.

Serum PON1 activity in a given population can vary by 40-fold.

PON1 is activated by PPAR-γ. (PPARG)

* increase PON1 expression.
  * The 55L allele results in significantly higher PON1 mRNA and serum protein levels and therefore activity compared to the 55M allele. ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15670573))([doi:10.1016/s0306-3623(98)00028-7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9703197))
  * The 108C allele has greater promoter activity than the 108T allele which results in different serum activities. (same refs)

* add a copy of both PON1-Q and PON1-R since they each preferentially degrade different substrates
  * PON1-Q192R polymorphism determines a substrate dependent effect on activity

# Smell, olfactory perception, hyperosmia, macrosmia

rs6591536 - detection of β-ionone (floral) fragrance

TODO: other hyperosmia (increased odor sensitivity) alleles? other hyperosmia in general?

TODO: see IRC logs for more information about olfactory neurons, olfactory cells, receptors, and canine olfactory receptor genetics that could be copied over to human.

Olfaction in humans is molecularly mediated by GPCRs (olfactory receptors). In insects, olfactory receptors are an unrelated group of ligand-gated ion channels.

Olfaction bypasses the thalamus and goes straight to cortical and limbic areas. Olfactory receptor neurons -> olfactory bulb -> piriform cortex and amygdala etc

[Kv1.3 -/- mice have a 1,000- to 10,000-fold lower threshold for detection of odors](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2737549/) and an increased ability to discriminate between odorants

TODO: simple transplantation of olfactory receptor genes from elephant or dog.

TODO: machine learning or computational design of olfactory receptor genes and insert a few thousand of these into the human genome. Instead of relying on existing olfactory genes found in nature, we could target various compounds that are of high human interest.

number of olfactory receptor genes by species: cow 1186, opossum 1188, rat 1207, elephant 1948, koala 1500, human 400, dogs 1100, pigs 1100; dogs, which are reputed to have good sense of smell, do not have the largest number of functional olfactory receptor genes.

dog:

* dog macrosmia might be due to [airflow in the nasal cavity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871809/).
* "1/8 of a dog's brain is devoted to analyzing smells"
* "canine olfactory bulb is 40x larger than in humans (relative to total brain size)"
* "A bloodhound can detect 1 part per 10 trillion, roughly equivalent to detecting a single drop of blood diluted in 20 olympic-sized swimming pools."
* if the canine olfactory limit is one part per trillion for certain molecular targets, then the operational scent threshold limit might be closer to one part per billion or worse depending on dog training, dog/handler teamwork efficiency, distractions, etc.
* [olfactory imprinting](https://gnusha.org/logs/2025-07-02.log) and neural coding of olfactory signals to neural discrimination puts a damper on neuralink olfactory sensor plans? this seems like an easy one or two orders of magnitude performance improvement on scent tracking tasks if by using neuralink you can decouple signal detection from animal behavior.

TODO: Develop a recombinase-driven genetic circuit that enables olfactory sensory neurons to stochastically assemble novel olfactory receptor variants from modular gene segment, analogous to immune V(D)J recombination. Make a biologically plausible strategy to generate in vivo receptor diversity and systematically enhace odor sensitivity and selectivity. Can we make a way to perceive viruses by smelling their protein capsid shell? Can we make a way to smell new nano-objects that were not genomically encoded via our pre-exisitng olfactory receptors?

# Taste

T1R generally covers both sweet and umami flavor

saltyness - ENaC

Taste is GPCRs (G-protein coupled receptors) and some ion channels. Taste perception goes from receptors -> cranial nerves VII, IX, X -> solitary nucleus -> thalamus -> gustatory cortex. Actually that might be wrong, see <https://gnusha.org/logs/2025-10-02.log> for more details. For hedonic reward from taste: parabrachial nucleus interneurons need to be modified for hedonic reward association against endocrine-linked nutrient sensors on those neurons. Positive hedonic gustatory value is encoded here by "high gamma phase locking" with ~something in VPMpc/BLA that starts a timing window initialized by orofacial sensorimotor pattern generator, anyway they watch for an expected spike and if it's late a FoxP2+ GABAergic interneuron in VPMpc is already depolarized or something. Maybe better to modify VPMpc interneurons to couple spike decision with internal nutritional deficiency status sensing?

TODO: look at olfactory perception enhancement proposals on this page and apply to taste as well? The actual circuit for hedonic value of olfactory perception has not been documented here yet.

let a new era of total gluttony now commence.

# Pain and pain insensitivity

You probably don't want full lifelong pain insensitivity. It's called a pathology for a very good reason.

rs6269: <http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs6269>

chronic back pain - rs12310519 in SOX5, rs7833174 between CCDC26 and GSDMC, and rs4384683 in DCC <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/20/244483">ref</a>

"A novel human pain insensitivity disorder caused by a point mutation in ZFHX2" <https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awx326/4725107>

[A pathological missense mutation in the deubiquitinase USP5 leads to insensitivity to pain](https://rupress.org/jem/article-abstract/222/8/e20241877/277946/A-pathological-missense-mutation-in-the)

"low pain" allele of SCN9A (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2096434/">ref</a>) - "nonsense mutations in Nav1.7 result in loss of Nav1.7 function and a condition known as channelopathy-associated insensitivity to pain, a rare disorder in which affected individuals are unable to feel physical pain". At this point there are now several different mutations discovered in SCN9A for pain insensitivity.

SCN9A mutations from [ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17167479/):

* p.Ser459Ter (S459X) c.1376C\>G in exon 10, nonsense mutation
* p.Ile767Ter (I767X) c.2298del in exon 13 (single-base deletion causing a frameshift and reinterpretation of a premature stop codon at 767)
* p.Trp897Ter (W897X) c.2691G\>A in exon 15, nonsense mutation

other scn9a mutations causing pain insensitivity:

* p.Arg1488Ter (R1488\*) ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30037327/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* splice-site variants ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29978519/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* dozens of SCN9A loss-of-function alleles underlying autosomal-recessive congenital pain insensitivity, most are truncating (nonsense/frameshift) or splicing changes ([ref](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-020-02419-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* all CIP-causing SCN9A variants are biallelic, loss-of-function disruptions in NaV1.7 expressed in nociceptors; affected individuals typically have lifelong pain absence and often anosmia, with otherwise intact large-fiber modalities.

FAAH pseudogene microdeletion leading to pain insensitivity and forgetfulness <a href="https://bjanaesthesia.org/article/S0007-0912(19)30138-2/fulltext">ref</a>; "We report the causative mutations for this new pain insensitivity disorder: the co-inheritance of (i) a microdeletion in dorsal root ganglia and brain-expressed pseudogene, FAAH-OUT, which we cloned from the fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) chromosomal region; and (ii) a common functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in FAAH conferring reduced expression and activity. Circulating concentrations of anandamide and related fatty-acid amides (palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamine) that are all normally degraded by FAAH were significantly elevated in peripheral blood compared with normal control carriers of the hypomorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism. The genetic findings and elevated circulating fatty-acid amides are consistent with a phenotype resulting from enhanced endocannabinoid signalling and a loss of function of FAAH." (however, please note that <a href="https://twitter.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1757849663644848211">FAH-OUT doesn't seem to be real</a> from looking at UK biobank data)

PRDM12 also plays a role in congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP), especially the syndrome often called PRDM12-related HSAN type VIII. PRDM12 ("PR domain zinc finger protein 12") is a transcriptional regulator. [PRDM12 structure includes](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/21/12030?utm_source=chatgpt.com) a PR domain (related to SET methyltransferases), several zinc fingers, and a poly-alanine tract. [PRDM12 is expressed](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.720973/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in nociceptor (pain-sensing) neuron precursors during development, and continues to be expressed in mature nociceptors. Here are some articles pertaining to PRDM12-linked congenital insensitivty to pain: [PRDM12 missense mutation in exon 3](https://journals.lww.com/jped/fulltext/2020/38030/hereditary_sensory_autonomic_neuropathy_type_viii_.17.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PRDM12 splicing error](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37021010/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and [other PRDM12 congenital insensitivty to pain variants](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/21/12030?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Loss of PRDM12 leads to absence or severe reduction of nociceptor neurons / nerve fibers (both small myelinated Aδ and unmyelinated C fibers) in the skin. Thus, the physical substrate for pain detection is missing or under‐developed. Disruption of downstream developmental programs: PRDM12 regulates expression of neurotrophic receptor NTRK1 (TrkA), among others. Without PRDM12, TrkA levels drop, leading to poor survival of nociceptor precursors.

opiod receptors (μ, δ, κ) are a common target for analgesics. glycine receptor anesthetics are targeted for immobility. there are many other targets for anesthetics and analgesics to consider.

TODO: specialty ligands to target cells such that we can turn on/off sensitivity to pain? instead of having total insensitivity 100% of the time.

TODO: various pain management things, including anesthetics, analgesics, pain killer compatibility, toxicity? knock-in of GABA-A subunits that have higher affinity to anesthetics? or reduce metabolizers of anesthetics to prolong effect?

# Ocular system

## Eye color (iris color)

green eye color - <a href="http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs7495174">rs7495174</a>

blue eye color - <a href="http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs12913832">rs12913832</a>

[loss of SLC45A2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0129273&utm_source=chatgpt.com) reduces melanosome pH and lightens pigmentation.

OCA2-HERC2 region on chromosome 15, which tunes melanosome pH and tyrosine activity

melanogenesis enzymes - TYR/TYRP1/DCT

transporters that set melanosome ion balance - OCA2, SLC45A2, SLC24A

PMEL organelle scaffolding proteins play a role here too.

In the back of the eye, the fundus color comes from melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid, plus the macula's yellow carotenoids (lutein/zeaxanthin) that are taken up by receptors like SCARB1 and CD36.

iris melanocytes: the iris looks brown when iris melanocytes have lots of eumelanin. With very little stromal melanin, shorter wavelengths are scattered in the collagenous stroma (Tyndall/Rayleigh scattering), so eyes look blue/gray even though there’s no blue pigment. Intermediate amounts and some long wavelengths reflectance produce green/hazel iris. ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9154287/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

TYRP1 and DCT/TYRP2 steer eumelanin chemistry. TYR (tyrosinase) is rate-limiting for [eumelanin production](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8516112/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Severe loss of TYRP1, DCT/TYRP2 causes forms of oculocutaneous albinism with very light irides.

OCA2 (P protein) forms/controls an anion conductance on the melanosome and raises lumenal pH; [reduced OCA2 function](https://elifesciences.org/articles/04543?utm_source=chatgpt.com) acidifies melanosomes, suppresses TYR, and lightens color. The famous enhancer SNP rs12913832 in HERC2 intron 86 lowers OCA2 expression in iris melanocytes and is the strongest common predictor of blue/light eyes. SLC45A2 (MATP) also helps neutralize melanosome pH; reduced function lightens pigmentation. SLC24A4 (NCKX4), a cation exchanger, is associated with eye color in GWAS and phenotyping panels.

transcriptional control of melanogenesis is via MITF, an enhancer variant near IRF4 alters TFAP2A/MITF cooperation and modulates TYR expression in melanocytes, and therefore impacts pigmentation.

PMEL builds the fibrillar matrix on which eumelanin is deposited; [disrupting PMEL](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3633693/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) affects melanosome maturation and visible pigment density. PMEL disruption causes inefficient pigment deposition leading to a lighter colored iris.

TPC2 (two-pore channel) tends to acidify melanosomes. higher TPC2 activity could reduce TYR activity.

brown iris color: high TYR pathway throughput + neutral-ish melanosome pH (OCA2/SLC45A2 set to "on"), densely melanized melanosomes leading to strong absorption. more melanin synthesis including TYR, TYRP1, DCT.

blue/gray iris color: low stromal melanin; structural scattering dominates in the stroma. blue is caused by lowers OCA2, while more OCA2 leads to darker pigmentation. less melanin synthesis for blue/gray.

green/hazel/amber: intermediate melanin + scattering; subtle shifts in eumelanin/pheomelanin balance and stromal optics.

melanosome pH (transporter) SLC45A2 (MATP) knockdown or mutation causes more acidification and therefore lighter iris color.

[melanosome cation balance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3694299/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) via SLC24A4 (NCKX4) mutations modulates pigment output.

[negative pH regulator TPC2](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/15/8273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), a channel that tends to acidify melanosomes, at higher activity level causes less melanin biogenesis.

more carotenoids like SCARB1, CD36 or receptors transporting lutein/zeaxanthin into retina causes denser macular yellow coloration.

For human eye color it is mostly about quantitative tuning of melanin plus stromal light scattering.

## Anti-myopia

see <http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003299> "Sixteen of the novel associations are in or near genes implicated in eye development, neuronal development and signaling, the visual cycle of the retina, and general morphology: BMP3, BMP4, DLG2, DLX1, KCNMA1, KCNQ5, LAMA2, LRRC4C, PRSS56, RBFOX1, RDH5, RGR, SFRP1, TJP2, ZBTB38, and ZIC2".

## Spectrum expansion and tetrachromacy

introduce an additional, spectrally distinct cone pigment (e.g., deliver an L-opsin into a subset of M-cones, or vice-versa; or add a tuned variant).

adult primate brains can exploit a new cone class without developmental rewiring. [AAV L-opsin delivery](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2782927/?utm_source=chatgpt.com); therefore, is a germline change required? taking hundreds of gene therapies is probably not ideal, so including extra L-opsin in the genome could make sense.

engineer amino-acid substitutions that shift peak absorption (λmax) of L/M opsins to widen separations based on [known tuning sites](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3075382/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in primate opsins.

[some human females are heterozygous for L opsin variants](https://www.neitzvision.com/research/publications/publications/1998-Neitz-L-cone_pigment_in_females-VisRes.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

ultraviolet vision spectrum: [ultraviolet-sensitive SWS1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8662652/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and reduce UV filtering by the lens/cornea (humans strongly block UV). UV is phototoxic to the retina and would require mitigation.

lots of available opsins from other animals, like tetrachromatic reptiles or birds.

## Near-infrared vision

TRP has been added to mouse retinal cells for near-infrared vision, but not infrared vision. [TRPV1 in human retinal organoids](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40885666/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) also for near-infrared.

often temperature-gated TRP channels (TRPA1 and TRPV1) are used in combination with gold nanorods to get near-infrared vision.

near-infrared vision in humans can be done by upconversion nanoparticles or [lenses that convert infrared to visible light](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867425004544?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Can these upconversion nanoparticles be proteins produced by human retinal cells?

## Infrared vision

Pit viper snakes like pythons and boas have specialized infrared-detecting pit organs with TRPA1 (transient receptor potential ankyrin 1) gene variants. These thermoreceptive TRPA1 channels are highly thermal sensitive that can detect temperature differences as small as 0.003 celsius. these receptors probably need to sit far away from vasculature so that they respond to radiant heat instead of internal body temperature variations.

The thermosensitive pit organ in snake has an external face membrane that looks out toward the air, and an internal face membrane that looks toward the underlying air-filled chamber. Warm arterial blood is prohibited from reaching the membrane. The temperature difference across the two faces is what the snake's thermosensitive receptors are measuring.

Fire-seeking jewel beetle (Melanophila acuminata) carries arrays of [photo-mechanosensitive "infrared sensilla"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003590050210?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Infrared warms a nanostructure, causing tiny mechanical changes that gate a mechanoreceptor. The principle is based on thermal expansion of many small dome-enclosed fluid-filled cavity converting infrared flux into a mechanosensory signal transduced via stretch-activated ion channels on a protein-chitin receptor membrane. Beetles can detect forest fires from many kilometers away. Various other insects have similar thermoception capabilities.

The infrared sensilla of the fire-seeking jewel beetle Melanophila acuminata are dome-shaped cuticular depressions, 12–15 µm in diameter, each housing a single, 200 µm-long, fluid-filled sensory organ composed of ≈70 mechanosensory neurons whose dendrites terminate on a thin (≈200 nm) protein–chitin receptor membrane that is mechanically deformed by the rapid (≈5 ms) thermal expansion of a fluid-filled cavity beneath the dome, converting minute (≈25 mK) infrared flux into a mechanosensory signal transduced via stretch-activated ion channels.

A microbolometer is a tiny, uncooled thermal sensor that detects infrared radiation by measuring the temperature-induced resistance change in a suspended microstructure. Can we make one out of proteins attached to an ion channel? infrared [[optogenetics]]? possibly a protein for this purpose could be evolved via in vitro directed evolution. could an aptamer do it? use knowledge of [[protein engineering]], [[optogenetics]], cytochrome C, chlorophyll, photosystems, etc.

maybe thermoresponsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) can be attached to a mechanosensitive channel (Piezo1). these ELPs have been used as [genetically encoded thermosensors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96049-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (ELP-TEMP) and as thermogenetic actuators in cells.

[cytochrome c protein as a potential sensing material for long-wavelength bolometers](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3871064/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) -- "We simulated and experimentally proved high infrared absorption of cytochrome c in the wavelength between 8 μm and 14 μm."

maybe use triplet-triplet annihilation in a protein assembly like in "[Photon upconversion supramolecular assemblies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39069661/)", however this seems to be mostly near-infrared-excitable not infrared-excitable.

## Other ocular

include day-specific vision changes, night-specific changes, maybe choose one per eye?

extra eye, retina and optic nerve

more axons in the optic nerve: [Bcl-2 overexpression (anti-apoptotic) causes increased global neuron survival](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7946326/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), more axons. In mice, this causes 40-50% more neurons in several CNS/PNS populations (including facial motor nucleus, retinal ganglion cells) and more axons in the facial and optic nerves.


more retinal ganglion cells, increase visual acuity? lense-related enhancements?

See [[biosight]] for more ocular enhancement notes.

# Hearing

<a href="http://snpedia.com/index.php/Hearing_loss">SNPs related to hearing loss</a>

perfect pitch - <a href="https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs3057">rs3057</a> near 8q24

increase [inner hair cell (IHC) nerve synapses](https://elifesciences.org/articles/03564?utm_source=chatgpt.com): boosting neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3/NT-3) in the cochlea increases IHC ribbon-synapse density and the amplitude of sound-evoked neural potentials. In mice, this causes better auditory processing relative to wildtype mice.

engineer various variants of the mechanosensors.

engineered prestin motor protein kinetics. copy from bat?

consider bat-derived actin-binding proteins or espin, fascin-2, or beta-actin variants knocked into human OHCs.

in OHCs, replace TMC1/2 isoforms with fast-gating variants from dolphins or echolocating bats.

for tectorial membrane stiffness modification, can this be done surgically? collagen-based hydrogel as a replacement maybe? basal turn implants?

# Voice

ABCC9 variants are associated with median voice pitch ([ref](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq2969?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06198-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) rs11046212-T (ABCC9, intronic) associates with higher median voice pitch in both Icelandic (non-tonal) and Mandarin (tonal) speakers. There are a handful of different ABCC9 mutations reported.

voice-associated genes include SOX9, ACAN, COL2A1, NFIX and XYLT1.

pitch variation is high in patients suffering from XYLT1 mutations. hoarseness of the voice is reported for some patients with mutations of ACAN. "Whether this is due to variation of the vocal tract and laryngeal anatomy influenced by the ACAN mutation or due to a scaled down vocal tract size in the case of the XYLT1 mutation which also causes primordial dwarfism is not yet clear."

[Sequence variants affecting voice pitch in humans](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10256171/)

Craniofacial shape, vocal tract morphology and vocal tract filter anatomy influences timbre and formants. There are various SNPs for nasion position (rs7559271 (PAX3)), nasal width (rs2424399), upper facial depth (rs12786942), intercanthal width (rs619686 and rs11093404), cranial base width (rs79272428 and rs6129564), nasal ala length (rs4648379 (PRDM16)), midface/nasion geometry (TP63 (rs17447439), C5orf50 (rs6555969), COL17A1, others).

# Hair

## Hair color

<https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Redheads> - MC1R SNPs like rs1805009(C;C), known as Asp294His or D294H; the most common variant associated with red hair and poor tanning ability in one study; rs1805007(T;T), known as Arg151Cys or R151C; associated with red hair, and in redheaded females, linked to being more responsive to the anesthetics pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol, often used by dentists; rs1805008(T;T), known as Arg160Trp or R160W; associated with red hair in an Irish population;

red hair SNPs from <a href="http://blog.23andme.com/2009/08/11/snpwatch-researchers-find-link-between-red-hair-and-avoiding-the-dentist/">23andme blog post</a>:

* rs34474212  C   S83P
* rs1805006   A   D84E
* rs11547464  A   R142H
* rs1110400   C   I155T
* i3002507    C   D294H

MC1R rs1805005, known as Val60Leu or V60L, associated with light blond hair in one study (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9302268?dopt=Abstract">PMID 9302268</a>).

MC1R variants may be associated with skin cancer and reduced effectiveness of painkillers. [geneticlifehacks](https://www.geneticlifehacks.com/the-redhead-gene/)

MC1R knockout resulted in gold mice with black eyes, but some mice had white coats with red eyes.([ref](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.03.641227v1.full#F6))

MC1R is also mentioned elsewhere on this page in other contexts, including skin and aging.

Hair color is superfluous because hair coloring dyes work.. but if you really want a germline genetic intervention for hair color, keep reading.

The visible color of a hair shaft is set by the [amount, type, and distribution of melanin granules (melanosomes) packed into cortical keratinocytes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1201498/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) as the hair is formed. Dark hair contains more, larger, ellipsoidal eumelanosomes (black/brown eumelanin); red/blond hair has fewer, smaller, more spherical pheomelanosomes (yellow/red pheomelanin). [Melanosomes are produced in hair bulb melanocytes, then transferred into matrix keratinocytes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968432818304608?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and ultimately into the hair cortex; this transfer can occur via exocytosis–phagocytosis, shed vesicles, or filopodial/membrane-fusion routes. After uptake, keratinocytes position melanin into supranuclear caps and retain it within the growing hair cortex.

MC1R pathway: α-MSH -> MC1R -> cAMP promotes eumelanin; antagonism by ASIP (agouti) shifts toward pheomelanin. Human genetics and mouse models establish MC1R as a key determinant of red/blond phenotypes. ([ref](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2016.00095/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Melanosome pH/ion handling tunes TYR activity and eumelanin:pheomelanin ratio. OCA2 and SLC45A2 help alkalinize maturing melanosomes; TPC2 (a two-pore channel) modulates melanosomal ion flux and is associated with blond hair variation in humans. ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8347052/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

PMEL forms the fibrillar melanosome matrix; mutants alter melanosome shape and reduce black pigment. Peripheral melanosome transport in melanocytes requires the Rab27a-Mlph-MyoVa complex; loss causes pigment dilution. ([ref](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002285&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

gray hair is from loss of melanocyte support from keratinocyte-derived SCF. graying can also be from local oxidative stress, H2O2 accumulation, loss of catalase/MSR enzymes, melanocyte stem cell failure in the follicle bulge, etc.

pheomelanin-rich to get yellow/red in mice. Red hair contains pheomelanin and low-molecular-weight benzothiazine/benzothiazole derivatives historically called trichochromes, derived from cysteinyldopa chemistry.

in human: OCA2/HERC2 (an enhancer modulating OCA2), SLC45A2, SLC24A5, TYR, KITLG, IRF4, and TPCN2. Large GWAS/meta-analyses in Europeans and multi-ancestry cohorts repeatedly implicate these loci; the IRF4 rs12203592 enhancer variant influences TYR via an MITF/TFAP2A-dependent mechanism and has also been linked to graying. ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29662168/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

melanosome size, shape, packing, and total granule load within hair-shaft keratinocytes strongly influence perceived color depth and brightness. ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15504086/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## Hair follicles and hair growth

Some smaller effects seen by WNT10A and FRAS1. TCHH is a major structural protein of the inner root sheath (IRS) and medulla.
* Asian-specific alleles of the EDAR and FGFR2 genes are associated with thick straight hair; EDAR is associated with hair thickness. [EDAR V370A](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/17/6/835/601141?utm_source=chatgpt.com) is associated with straight and thick hair.

* KRT71 / KRT74 / KRT25 are keratins of the inner root sheath, missense variants destabilize keratin intermediate filaments and change shaft molding. woolly/curly phenotypes (KRT71 AD woolly hair; KRT74 AD woolly hair; KRT25 AR woolly hair).


* Long-hair phenotypes / anagen prolongation - FGF5, a catagen trigger; human loss-of-function causes trichomegaly (very long eyelashes) and generally prolongs anagen.

some other things to consider doing:

* knock-down androgen receptors in dermal papilla cells in scalp
* 5-α-reductase deficienc but only in hair: reduce SRD5A2 (type-2 5-α-reductase) in dermal papilla, connective tissue sheath, outer root sheath.
* block the production of DKK1 (a Wnt antagonist) in dermal papilla cells, or block its action in epithelial LRP5/6. DHT induces DKK1 in balding DP, and DKK1 drives keratinocyte apoptosis and anagen to catagen regression.
* block or reduce expression of IL-6 and TGFB1 in dermal papilla cells in scalp, or block their receptors in matrix/bulge keratinocytes.
* lower PTGDS (PGD2 synthase) locally and/or block GPR44 on follicular cells

hair pro-growth pathways:

* boost Wnt/beta-catenin in dermal papilla cells or epithelium. blocking secreted Wnt inhibitors (SFRP1, DKK1) enhances human hair growth ex vivo.
* in the follicular epithelium, human FGF5 loss-of-function leads to trichomegaly (long hair)
* increase local VEGF expression for angiogenesis in outer root sheath keratinocytes around baldness-prone follicles.
* in bulge or outer root sheath epithelium, JAK initiates anagen in mice and boosts growth signals in human follicles ex vivo.

TODO:

* hair growth rate modulation? human hair follicles grow at a rate of about 10,000 nm/hour. can we pattern hair types, growth rates, etc, to different skin patches or regions? hair where we want it, and not where we don't?
* what about: TET-expression control of inducible hair follicle coloration?
* genetic inducible hair follicle style switching (switch between curly, wavy, woolly, straight, thick, etc.)
* what about using hair follicle coloring as a molecular sensor of metabolites, drugs, hormones, or other circulating blood factors?
* human hair drug testing is already a thing; hair drug testing is also used in wildlife and livestock ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35112231/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* what about a [[lineage tracing]] system that works in the hair follicle bulb, or hair matrix, such that the matrix generates cells that encode information about the molecular environment, and then that information is then transferred into keratin filaments inside each of those cells that ultimately make up the human hair follicle? or otherwise makes the data available via DNA sequencing (although a system where a simple optical microscope can extract information would be better).
* what about using modified keratin filaments inside of cortical keratinocytes as a protein molecular recording device of cellular state, then use protein sequencing (or optical microscope?) to extract information about cellular history, see [analog recording of gene regulation dynamics over weeks using intracellular protein tapes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.10.653182v1.abstract). Can this be done with keratin filaments instead? or as an alternative to keratin filaments inside hair follicles? or done with stereocilia, chitinous chaeta, etc? "CytoTape is a living "protein ticker-tape" molecular memory device: a long intracellular protein filament or thread that grows continuously from one end made up of multiple sections or beads. Each bead can carry a short, unique peptide tag whose appearance is dictated by a chosen promoter. When the promoter is active, the tag is made, it is then threaded onto the growing tip, and it is then locked in place. Because growth proceeds at a steady nanometers-per-hour rate, distance from the tip automatically encodes elapsed time. Multiple events can be recorded in parallel on the same filament using simultaneous recording of five distinct tags. After days or weeks the cell is fixed, the filament is stained with tag-specific antibodies conjugated to distinct fluorophores, and a diffraction-limited microscopy line scan converts spatial position (distance from the tip) into a temporal trace of each promoter's activity. This yields multiplexed, single-cell analog recordings."
* in insects and arthropods, epidermal trichogen cells generate a "cellular hair", like for mechanosensory hairs; these hairs are chitinous chaeta or cuticular outgrowths.
* human inner ear "hair cells" produce hair which is not a keratinocyte type hair follicle; each hair cell carries or protrudes a hair bundle made of dozens of stereocilia (actin-based microvili) and not keratin shafts. there's stereocilia (unbranched actin filaments), kinocilium (microtubule-based cilium), and outer hair cells. Various studies have used cellular hair protrusions as a biosensor recorder: [ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6575585/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8789910/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [kidney cilia](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43002-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [in vivo cilia labeling](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3700774/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ciliary targeting sequences for transmembrane proteins](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11240719/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [bacterial flagellar filaments](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22447900/) with flagellin that travels through a 2 nm central hole, [amyloid fibers](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2634518/?utm_source=chatgpt.com),  ... this gets you cilium-based expression profiling or recording.
* what about using tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) for recording cellular information?
* In cancer biology, microtentacles are extremely thin, actin-rich membrane projections that form on the surface of detached or circulating cancer cells. These are not classical filopedia or invadopedia; instead, microtentacles are tubulin-based structures enriched in detyrosinated α-tubulin and EB1. Microtentacles extend for tens of micrometers from the cell body and persist for hours or days.
* what is the longest single cell hair that has been produced or discovered? very long cilia? very long chitinous growth from a cell?
* neurons: use cellular cilia extrusion length segment types to record information about neuronal cell internal/external microenvironment.
* could single hair protrusions or cilium be used for protein purification? just collect the cilia from the cells?
* ribosome-level cellular event recorder using promiscuous codons (or a subet of promiscuous codons that are based on cell expression activity) to incorporate data into a growing amino acid chain

# Skin

Albinism is probably the easiest way to go here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculocutaneous_albinism#Types">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculocutaneous_albinism#Types</a>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo#Causes">Vitiligo</a> seems to be related to a mutation in tyrosinase (TYR), similar to albinism. In vitiligo, there is a destruction of melanocytes.

melanosome transfer disorder, creating localized spots of depigmentation - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus_depigmentosus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus_depigmentosus</a>

"Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes and it is the main determinant of the skin color of darker-skinned humans. The skin color of people with light skin is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the dermis and by the hemoglobin circulating in the veins of the dermis. Humans with naturally occurring light skin have varied amounts of smaller and scarcely distributed eumelanin and its lighter-coloured relative, pheomelanin. The concentration of pheomelanin varies highly within populations from individual to individual, but it is more commonly found among East Asians, Native Americans, and Northern Europeans with red hair."

"Organelles which contain pigments, called melanosomes, are smaller and less numerous in light-skinned humans."

* "Inhibition of melanosome transfer results in skin lightening" <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15409418">ref</a>
* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism#Genetics">albinism genetics</a> - OCA1, OCA2; "A mutation in the human TRP-1 gene may result in the deregulation of melanocyte tyrosinase enzymes, a change that is hypothesized to promote brown versus black melanin synthesis."

"Variations in the KITL gene have been positively associated with about 20% of melanin concentration differences between African and non-African populations. One of the alleles of the gene has an 80% occurrence rate in Eurasian populations. The ASIP gene has a 75–80% variation rate among Eurasian populations compared to 20–25% in African populations. Variations in the SLC24A5 gene account for 20–25% of the variation between dark and light skinned populations of Africa, and appear to have arisen as recently as within the last 10,000 years. The Ala111Thr or rs1426654 polymorphism in the coding region of the SLC24A5 gene reaches fixation in Europe, but is found across the globe, particularly among populations in Northern Africa, the Horn of Africa, West Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. Whilst not all of these genes directly affect melanin production, most of them code for proteins that may play a significant role in melanogenesis and control melanin concentration. Some of these genes are found to be more prevalent in certain population than others."

"the SLC24A5 gene account for 20–25% of the variation between dark and light skinned populations of Africa"

"The characteristic of fair skin, red hair, and freckling is associated with high amount of pheomelanin, little amounts of eumelanin. This phenotype is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. However, variations in the MC1R gene sequence only have considerable influence on pigmentation in populations where red hair and extremely fair skin is prevalent. The gene variation’s primary effect is to promote eumelanin synthesis at the expense of pheomelanin synthesis, although this contributes to very little variation in skin reflectance between different ethnic groups. Melanocytes from light skin cells cocultured with keratinocytes give rise to a distribution pattern characteristic of light skin."

We focus on melanosome biogenesis, transport and transfer, melanogenic regulators in melanocytes and factors derived from keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, hormones, inflammatory cells and nerves. Enzymatic components of melanosomes include tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 and dopachrome tautomerase, which depend on the functions of OA1, P, MATP, ATP7A and BLOC-1 to synthesize eumelanins and pheomelanins. The main structural component of melanosomes is Pmel17/gp100/Silv, whose sorting involves adaptor protein 1A (AP1A), AP1B, AP2 and spectrin, as well as a chaperone-like component, MART-1. During their maturation, melanosomes move from the perinuclear area toward the plasma membrane. Microtubules, dynein, kinesin, actin filaments, Rab27a, melanophilin, myosin Va and Slp2-a are involved in melanosome transport. Foxn1 and p53 up-regulate skin pigmentation via bFGF and POMC derivatives including α-MSH and ACTH, respectively. Other critical factors that affect skin pigmentation include MC1R, CREB, ASP, MITF, PAX3, SOX9/10, LEF-1/TCF, PAR-2, DKK1, SCF, HGF, GM-CSF, endothelin-1, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, neurotrophins and neuropeptides. UV radiation up-regulates most factors that increase melanogenesis. Further studies will elucidate the currently unknown functions of many other pigment genes/proteins."

## Skin perception

Human skin tactile resolution is approximately 10 nm at the high end.

goals: enhance sensory mechanoreceptors in human skin like touch-sensitive cells, mechanical prssure sensor, high resolution spatial tactile detail detection. lamellar receptors for deep pressure sensory modification. better receptors. more receptors. more sensory neurons. more nerve fibers.

increase cutaneous mechanoreceptor/afferent supply or Merkel-cell numbers. increase innervation, hyperinnervation.

Merkel cell neurite complexes and Meissner corpuscles are located superficially and contribute mainly to light touch and flutter. For the sensation of firm, steady pressure instead consider lamellated (Pacinian) corpuscles and the Ruffini endings.

in mice:

* [NT-3 (K14-NT3) overexpression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8707832/?utm_source=chatgpt.com): more dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, larger touch domes, more Merkel cells per dome, and denser innervation of touch domes and hair follicles. enhanced touch dome innervation.

Increase merkel cell numbers by transcriptional programming via [epidermal Atoh1 ectopic expression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4510865/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Expand sensory-neuron populations via apoptosis blockade: [Bax knockout (Bax-/-)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2994063/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) prevents developmental culling, leading to more DRG neurons and cutaneous hyperinnervation. LTMR receptive fields can shrink to accommodate the larger population, implying finer tiling. Also shows enhanced mechanical sensitivity (mostly studied in nociception context).

Piezo2 is the principal transducer for LTMRs and Merkel-cell complexes. Sensitization studies exist using Piezo2 knock-in but mainly these studies focused on pain.

[epidermal ephrin down-tuning](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2815134/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) might increase local nerve fiber entry.

For primates, very risky to do GH/GHRH upregulation or SOCS2 loss of function for GH hypersensitivity.

In human, FGFR3 partial loss of function and NPR3 loss of function both increase height but come with skeletal disproportions.

Instead, consider CNP-NPR2 signaling like with NPR2 gain-of-function or CNP related changes.

Focus genetic modifications on epiphyseal growth-plate chondrocytes, espcially the columnar proliferative and pre-hypertrophic zones, because that is where endochrondal elongation is programmed. Activating [NPR2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9024524/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) increases stature and CNP analogs raise growth velocity assuming open plates.

Try to avoid premature plate exhaustion.

Growth plate [resting zone](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6251707/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) chondrocytes (the stem cell pool) has cells like PTHrP⁺ chondrocytes with stem-like properties that feed the columnar compartment, and modulating them can extend the duration and supply of growth, not just the rate, which could be a target if the goal is to prolong the growth window (delay senescence/closure) rather than simply speed up elongation, but has some risk of dysplasia or niche exhaustion.

For bone width or growth plate supply, consider [perichondrial groove of ranvier](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2750766/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) or perichondrium to widen plates and feed progenitors. Might trigger neoplasias or cartilage tumors, bone tumors in mice?

osteoblast lineage cells (periosteal or endosteal) set diameter, cortical thickness, and mass. They don't control the rate of endochondral elongation, which is chondrocyte-driven.

# High altitude adaptations

[High-altitude human adaptation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4201282/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) targets the hypoxia-sensing axis: EPAS1 (HIF-2α) and EGLN1 (PHD2) variants tune ventilatory/hematologic responses and are associated with population differences in oxygenation at altitude.

* EPAS1 prevents high-altitude blood-thickening process, and is responsible for the Sherpa people being able to survive in high altitude environments (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13408">ref1</a><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3515610/">ref2</a>)

* [MTHFR mutation for high altitude](http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/16/4189.full.pdf)
* ethiopians show efficient oxygen use without elevated hemoglobin, possibly because of vascular adaptations.
* people born and raised at high altitude often have greater lung volumes. make big lungs. use growth hormone?
* enlarged right ventricle of the heart supports increased blood flow to the lungs for gas exchange.
* diet rich in iron and antioxidants
* make an effort to mitigate hypoxia-related stress
* decrease blood-gas barriers for faster oxygen diffusion
* increase vascularization of tissues to improve oxygen diffusion, like in yaks and llamas or other high-altitude mammals.
* better hemoglobin: bar-headed goose hemoglobin binds oxygen more tightly, allowing efficient oxygen uptake in low-oxygen air at altitudes over 9 km where they migrate over the himalaya mountains.
* decrease size of red blood cells (RBCs) and make them more oval shaped like high-altitude mammals?
* increase size of heart
* increase mitochondrial density, review [mitochondrial adaptations for high-altitude review article](https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/58/3/506/5032883)
* some high-altitude animals favor pathways that produce ATP efficiently under hypoxia (e.g., higher citrate synthase and cytochrome oxidase activity); [Molecular evolution of cytochrome c oxidase underlies high-altitude flight](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/28/1/351/981824) - this reference identifies amino-acid substitutions in COX subunits associated with high-altitude performance, supporting altered/efficient COX function under hypoxia.
* TODO: compare EPAS1 and EGLN1 genes in tibetan yaks, bar-headed geese, tibetan antelope, with respect to regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathways for oxygen sensing.
* TODO: cross-species comparison of hemoglobin

Respiratory adaptations: increase surface area of lungs across alveolar membranes to improve oxygen diffusion. Increase ventilation rate.

Circulatory adaptations: increase red blood cell (RBC) count. More RBCs and hemoglobin help transport additional oxygen to tissues. Increase hemoglobin concentration to enhance oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. Better hemoglobin. Increase capillary density to improve oxygen delivery to muscles, brain.

Cellular and metabolic adaptations for high altitude: more mitochondria per cell. Shift towards glucose metabolism and glucose oxidation to require less oxygen per ATP molecule produced compared to fat oxidation. Increase the production 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) to facilitate oxygen release from hemoglobin to tissues.

"[Convergent changes across high-altitude taxa](https://elifesciences.org/articles/56259) included increased hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase activities, decreased lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase, and cytochrome c oxidase activities, and increased myoglobin content. ATP synthase activity increased in only the longest established high-altitude taxa, whereas hexokinase activity increased in only newly established taxa. Therefore, changes in pathways of lipid oxidation, glycolysis, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are common strategies to cope with high-altitude hypoxia, but some changes require longer evolutionary time to arise."

## Language and speech

Larger spoken word vocabulary size and word vocalization at age 15 to 18 months: ROBO2 region on chr3p12.3, rs7642482 and rs9854781 are associated with larger spoken word vocabulary size and more word vocalization at age 15-18 months. ROBO2 encodes a roundabout axon guidance receptor. ROBO proteins help growing neurons navigate and tell axons where to extend, when to cross or not cross the brain's midline, and how to wire long-range connections in cortex and subcortex. ROBO2 helps set up the wiring of circuits that control speech planning, motor control of the mouth, auditory-motor integration, etc., during very early brain development.


Common variants of CNTNAP2 are associated with earlier language acquisition and structural language abilities. CNTNAP2 common variant rs7794745 has been repeatedly linked to language-related processing differences in the general population. CNTNAP2 is part of the FOXP2 regulatory pathway.


[Humanized Foxp2 accelerates learning by enhancing transitions from declarative to procedural performance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4191787/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) -- "The human form of forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) is the leading genetic candidate for human speech and language proficiency. We demonstrate that the introduction of the amino acid changes that occurred during human evolution into murine Foxp2 profoundly affects learning and striatal neuroplasticity. These mice learn stimulus–response associations more rapidly than WT mice when declarative (i.e., place-based) and procedural (i.e., response-based) forms of learning could interfere with one another. [...] We hypothesize that the human FOXP2 evolution led to differential tuning of corticostriatal systems involved in declarative and procedural learning and thus contributed to adapting the human brain for speech and language acquisition."

FOXP2 deficiencies are associated with speech disorders, motor learning difficiencies (including motor output pertaining to speech articulation), and other speech-motor skills. For example, childhood apraxia of speech is associated with FOXP2 and causes impairment of motor planning or programming of speech articulation movements. FOXP2 is a transcription factor important for cortico-striatal and cerebellar circuits that support speech sequencing and aspects of complex language processing. [FOXP2 was discovered in a language-impaired family](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2760059/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) where many affected members had a heterozygous missense mutation in FOXP2. Those affected members of that family showed: childhood apraxia of speech (motor planning problems), severe deficits in expressive grammar and morphological production (e.g. tense, plural, agreement), and difficulty with complex syntax and grammatical comprehension.

[FOXP1 disruptions](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9139417/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) produce broad expressive/receptive language deficits, including grammar, syntax, plus cognitive and social issues.

[Stuttering is associated with mutations in GNPTAB, GNPTG, NAGPA, AP4E1, DRD2, CYP17A1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02267-2).

Genetic and molecular basis of developmental language disorder ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9139417/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))



the section on "neural basis of sound production in non-human primates" is very interesting: <https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3047712/> "Jürgens (2009) proposed two separate pathways involved in the control of vocalizations: The first runs from the anterior cingulate cortex via the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) into the reticular formation of pons and medulla oblongata and from there to the phonatory motoneurons. The midbrain PAG serves as a collector or relay station for the descending vocalization-controlling pathways, integrating incoming information and triggering specific innate vocal patterns. Electrical stimulation of this area elicits vocalizations in several species. The second vocalization control pathway runs from the motor cortex via the reticular formation to the phonatory motoneurons. Reduced dopamine release in the striatum is positively correlated with speed and accuracy of phonological processing (Tettamanti et al. 2005), parts of the striatum are involved in lexical-semantic control (Crinion et al. 2006), and, depending on the subregions involved, patients with Huntington's disease have difficulties in the recovery of lexical information and the application of combinatorial rules (Teichmann et al. 2008)."

[Foxp2 levels mediates sex differences in ultrasonic vocalization by rat pups](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3727442/) - "We observed that isolated male rat pups emitted substantially more USV calls and these were characterized by a significantly lower frequency and amplitude compared with female rat pups. Moreover, the dam was more likely to first retrieve male pups back to the nest, then females. The amount of Foxp2 protein was significantly higher in multiple regions of the developing male brain compared with females and a reduction of brain Foxp2 by siRNA eliminated the sex differences in USVs and altered the order of pup retrieval. Our results implicate Foxp2 as a component of the neurobiological basis of sex differences in vocal communication in mammals. We extended these observations to humans, a species reported to have gender differences in language acquisition, and found the amount of FOXP2 protein in the left hemisphere cortex of 4-year-old boys was significantly lower than in age-matched girls."


foxp2 gain of function mutation proposals:

* Helix‑3 basic substitution: add an extra positively charged side chain to the DNA‑recognition helix of the forkhead domain, increasing electrostatic contacts with the phosphate backbone and raising sequence‑specific DNA‑binding affinity. Try to strengthen transcriptional repression of FOXP2 targets.
* Wing‑tip Arg insertion: add a basic residue at the tip of the minor‑groove wing, creating a new hydrogen‑bond network. Try to increase binding occupancy or motif selectivity.
* Leucine‑zipper hydrophobic upgrade: replace a core leucine in the coiled‑coil heptad with bulkier isoleucine, expanding the buried hydrophobic core and lowering the dimerization free energy requirement. stabilize foxp2-foxp2 dimers and cooperative DNA binding.
* Inter‑chain salt‑bridge: increase dimer stability.
* C‑terminal nuclear‑localization signal (PKKKRKV): fused to the end of the forkhead domain to get more efficient nuclear import.
* remove or weaken a degron
* consider something something dCas9‑based transcriptional effectors, activators, repressors, and Cas9 fusion for foxp2


Mice that are homozygous or heterozygous for [deletion of Dlx5/6 in GABAergic neurons](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/pmc8557472/) show increased vocalizations and increased socialization, along with a [33% improvement in life expectancy](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6756896/). Also this is associated with some nearby human-accelerated regions (HARs).


There are many other FOX variants to consider targeting or enhancing the effects of: foxp1, foxp2, FoxO6, foxp3, foxp4, foxc, foxg, etc.

## Reading ability

[rs11208009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9436320/) for single word reading accuracy and word reading ability. Might be related to DOCK7 regulation in brain. You need efficient temporo-parietal and occipito-temporal circuitry for rapid word recognition. The superior temporal or temporo-parietal system and occipito-temporal "visual word form" system are core to fluent word reading.

DYX1C1-rs3743205, DYX1C1-rs57809907, KIAA0319-rs9461045, and KIAA0319-Haplotype: "The association between rs3743205 and rs57809907 with reading skills is partially mediated by phonological awareness. Specifically, the rs3743205-C/C genotype and carrying the minor A allele of rs57809907 were associated with lower phonological awareness scores which in turn was correlated with poorer reading skills." ([ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X25000215))

"The generalist genes hypothesis ([Kovas and Plomin, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00521.x), [Plomin and Kovas, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.131.4.592)) states that the genes responsible for reading disabilities are largely the same genes responsible for normal variation in reading abilities."


* phonological awareness: DCDC2 (READ1 regulatory locus), KIAA0319 (6p22)
* phonological memory (including nonword repetition): ATP2C2 (16q), CMIP (16q), CNTNAP2 (7q35-q36)

anatomy: <a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0896-6273(03)00803-1">Hyerplexia</a> is characterized by increased neuronal activation in the left superior temporal cortex, and this same areas is under activated in dyslexic individuals.

anatomy: arcuate fasciculus anatomy predicts phonological skill and reading skill ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3214008/?utm_source=chatgpt.com); [word learning](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1301696110?utm_source=chatgpt.com); [literacy acquisition](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/24/4/989/325113?utm_source=chatgpt.com) is associated with anatomical changes in arcuate fasciculus. left lateralized arcuate fasciculus development is associated with improvement in reading ability. The long segment or direct segment of the arcuate fasciculus is specifically associated with improvements in reading ability, and not the other segments of the arcuate fasciculus. It connects posterior temporal cortex (around Wernicke's area) directly to the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area). The direct segment of the arcuate fasciculus supports phonological processing, speech repetition, and reading aloud and described in the in the Wernicke-Geschwind model. Growth or stronger integrity of the direct segment correlates with better phonological awareness and reading acquisition. The anterior segment is involved in articulatory planning and verbal working memory. The posterior segment is involved in lexical-semantic integration and phonological storage. The axons of the direct segment arise from pyramidal projection neurons in layer III derived from radial glia-born excitatory neuron lineages of the dorsal telencephalon (pallium). The germinal zone for these cells is the dorsal telencephalic ventricular zone (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ), specifically in lateral and inferior frontal and posterior temporal pallial sectors. Radial glial cells (RGCs) generate excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal neurons via asymmetric division. Later, intermediate progenitors (IPs) in the SVZ amplify these lineages. Patterned by gradients of transcription factors such as PAX6, EMX2, TBR1, SATB2, FEZF2, and CUX1. SATB2 in particular marks callosal and association projection neurons, including those forming the arcuate fasciculus. Most literature treats the direct arcuate fasciculus as a bidirectional fiber bundle with axons from L3 pyramidal neurons at both termini. Recommended approach: expand the progenitor pools that specifically generate callosal or association enurons (SATB2+, CUX1+, BRN2+, FEZF2low), increase the likelihood of these progentiors adopting a long-range projection fate rathe rthan short-range or cortico-spinal fate, etc. Increase the neurogenic period of radial glial cells with at least one extra round of asymmetric division.

dyslexia candidate genes (DYX1C1, DCDC2, KIAA0319, ROBO1) repeatedly linked to auditory/temporal-processing pathways that forecast reading achievement ([ref](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.981801/full)).

(Impairment only): mutations in ATP2C2 and CMIP have been associated with nonword repetition and phonological short-term memory, which are skills that are tightly linked to acquiring morphosyntax because you need to hold and manipulate morphologically inflected forms. However this is primarily an impairment and not related to normal range of variation in healthy population.

DRD2: "DRD2 A1/A1 genotype had a significantly higher intelligence than A2/A2 carriers [81]. In addition, a relationship between the striatal dopamine receptor D2 and verbal intelligence quotient was found [82]." (Tsai, S.-J., Yu, Y.W.-Y., Lin, C.-H., Chen, T.-J., Chen, S.-P., and Hong, C.-J., Neuropsychobiology, 2002, vol. 45, no. 3, pp. 128–130.) (Guo, J.F., Yang, Y.K., Chiu, N.T., Yeh, T.L., Chen, P.S., Lee, I.H., and Chu, C.L., Psychol. Med., 2006, vol. 36, no. 4, pp. 547–554.)

"... our results indicate that the human genes encoding adenylyl cyclase 8 (ADCY8), the γ catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PRKACG), the γ subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2G), 2a and 2b subunits of the ionotropic NMDA glutamate receptor (GRIN2A, GRIN2B), metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3), and protein kinase C α (PRKCA) are important for human memory function, because variability among these genes was specifically associated with memory performance and with activation in memory-related brain regions." (ref: <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/103/11/4270">Identification of a genetic cluster influencing memory performance and hippocampal activity in humans (2006)</a>)

* investigate hippocampus structural alterations vs molecular tweaks
* heritability of long-term memory? heritability of short-term memory?

Activation of the cAMP/PKA intracellular pathway in the striatum is sufficient to [increase working memory capacity in mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57788-5). This has been achieved with optogenetics in mice to increase measured working memory capacity from 6 to 8 (30% increase). They also found that decreasing the activity of Parvalbumin interneuron activation in the striatum mPFC-STR pathway can improve working memory capacity in some circumstances. "These findings align with pre-clinical and clinical studies on the effects of cortical and striatal phosphodiesterase inhibitors (which increase cAMP levels) in regulating working memory." For germline there are several options such as inhibitory optogenetics of the parvalbumin interneurons to not otherwise infringe on higher working memory capacity. Driving or increasing the cAMP/PKA pathway in striatum is another option for germline intervention from this article. Again this is in mice.

### SNAP25

SNPs in the SNAP25 gene were <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17160701?dopt=Abstract">initially linked to intelligence</a> but <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19418213?dopt=Abstract">have failed to replicate</a>.

TLCN (telencephalin / ICAM-5) knockout in mice improves hippocampus LTP ([x](https://u-toyama.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/enhancement-of-hippocampal-ltp-reference-memory-and-sensorimotor-/)). TLCN is a negative regulator of dendritic spine maturation in hippocampal neurons. TLCN knockout promotes more mature spines ([x](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16467526/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

[STIM1 overexpression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488916303202?utm_source=chatgpt.com) - LTD impaired, lower anxiety-like behavior, improvements in contextual learning. perturbation of metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling.

[neuritin overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7880330/) - reduced degradation of the DNA repair factor poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) in the hippocampus, indicating decreased hippocampal apoptosis rate, and a greater number of surviving hippocampal neurons during the first week after transient global ischemia and also showing improved recovery of spatial learning. This is mainly an ischemia study but lower hippocampus apoptosis sounds useful. In injury/recovery shows signs of upregulation of NF-200, synaptophysin, GAP-43 which are "regeneration markers" in mice.

## Immediate early genes and enhancement

Some "immediate early genes" seem to have an enhancement effect in mice ([x](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-025-05203-x))?

* Zif268 (Egr-1) - an IEG transcription factor - this zinc finger transcription factor has lots of roles in memory recall, learning. ([x](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-025-05203-x))
* Narp - an IEG effector - transgenic overexpression or virus-driven increase enhances excitatory drive onto parvalbumin interneurons, rescues ocular dominance plasticity, and improves cognitive flexibility.
* Arc - an IEG effector - sustained Arc expression promotes LTP consolidation, and Arc-mediated priming of mGluR-dependent LTD is required for synaptic depression. Elevation of Arc (via transgenic or virus strategies) enhances synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. (Arc is a weird one and I'm not sure if we have any evidence of Arc in the human brain yet.)

ADAM12 can "shed" HB-EGF, an EGFR ligand. HB-EGF/EGFR signaling supports hippocampal plasticity and learning. ADAM12 cleaves IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-3/-5), increasing free IGF available to activate IGF1 receptors. IGF1 signaling is strongly implicated in synaptic plasticity, LTP and memory across animal and human studies. Reports exist of ADAM12 expression in oligodendrocyte lineage cells and during demyelination.

Here, we successfully generated 11 transgenic rhesus monkeys (8 first-generation and 3 second-generation) carrying human copies of MCPH1, an important gene for brain development and brain evolution. Brain-image and tissue-section analyses indicated an altered pattern of neural-cell differentiation, resulting in a delayed neuronal maturation and neural-fiber myelination of the transgenic monkeys, similar to the known evolutionary change of developmental delay (neoteny) in humans. Further brain-transcriptome and tissue-section analyses of major developmental stages showed a marked human-like expression delay of neuron differentiation and synaptic-signaling genes, providing a molecular explanation for the observed brain-developmental delay of the transgenic monkeys. More importantly, the transgenic monkeys exhibited better short-term memory and shorter reaction time compared with the wild-type controls in the delayed-matching-to-sample task. The presented data represent the first attempt to experimentally interrogate the genetic basis of human brain origin using a transgenic monkey model and it values the use of non-human primates in understanding unique human traits."

[BEC1/KCNH3 knockout enhances cognitive function](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/29/46/14637) -- "The K+ channel, one of the determinants for neuronal excitability, is genetically heterogeneous, and various K+ channel genes are expressed in the CNS. The therapeutic potential of K+ channel blockers for cognitive enhancement has been discussed, but the contribution each K+ channel gene makes to cognitive function remains obscure. BEC1 (KCNH3) is a member of the K+ channel superfamily that shows forebrain-preferential distribution. Here, we show the critical involvement of BEC1 in cognitive function. BEC1 knock-out mice performed behavioral tasks related to working memory, reference memory, and attention better than their wild-type littermates. Enhanced performance was also observed in heterozygous mutants. The knock-out mice had neither the seizures nor the motor dysfunction that are often observed in K+ channel-deficient mice. In contrast to when it is disrupted, overexpression of BEC1 in the forebrain caused the impaired performance of those tasks. It was also found that altering BEC1 expression could change hippocampal neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. The results indicate that BEC1 may represent the first K+ channel that contributes preferentially and bidirectionally to cognitive function."

SP0535: [A human-specific de novo gene promotes cortical expansion and folding](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.202204140) -- "Here, a human-specific de novo gene, SP0535, is identified that is preferentially expressed in the ventricular zone of the human fetal brain and plays an important role in cortical development and function. In human embryonic stem cell-derived cortical organoids, knockout of SP0535 compromises their growth and neurogenesis. In SP0535 transgenic (TG) mice, expression of SP0535 induces fetal cortex expansion and sulci and gyri-like structure formation. The progenitors and neurons in the SP0535 TG mouse cortex tend to proliferate and differentiate in ways that are unique to humans. SP0535 TG adult mice also exhibit improved cognitive ability and working memory. Mechanistically, SP0535 interacts with the membrane protein Na+/K+ ATPase subunit alpha-1 (ATP1A1) and releases Src from the ATP1A1-Src complex, allowing increased level of Src phosphorylation that promotes cell proliferation. Thus, SP0535 is the first proven human-specific de novo gene that promotes cortical expansion and folding, and can function through incorporating into an existing conserved molecular network."

Gene duplications constitute a major evolutionary force, but their impact on human brain development remains unclear. Using tailored RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we profiled the spatial and temporal expression of hominid-specific duplicated (HS) genes in the human fetal cortex and identified a repertoire of 35 HS genes displaying robust and dynamic patterns during cortical neurogenesis. Among them **NOTCH2NL**, human-specific paralogs of the NOTCH2 receptor, stood out for their ability to promote cortical progenitor maintenance. NOTCH2NL promote the clonal expansion of human cortical progenitors, ultimately leading to higher neuronal output. At the molecular level, NOTCH2NL function by activating the Notch pathway through inhibition of cis Delta/Notch interactions. Our study uncovers a large repertoire of recently evolved genes active during human corticogenesis and reveals how human-specific NOTCH paralogs may have contributed to the expansion of the human cortex."

* IGF-2 (insulin-like growth factor 2), but only for memory consolidation

"The role of non-coding RNA in memory formation has been reported in a number of publications [46, 47]. RNA-mediated “memory transfer” was recently demonstrated in the marine mollusk Aplysia [48]. Total RNA was extracted from neurons of Aplysia subjected to sensitization training by tail electroshock and injected into neurons of naive mollusks. Snails injected with the RNA of the trained snails showed higher levels of siphon withdrawal reflex as compared to the control group. These data confirm the epigenetic hypothesis of memory formation and can be used in future studies on the possibility of memory stimulation."

In the mouse neocortex, SRGAP2 promotes spine maturation and limits spine density. Expression of SRGAP2C phenocopies SRGAP2 deficiency. It underlies sustained radial migration and leads to the emergence of human-specific features, including neoteny during spine maturation and increased density of longer spines."

AMPAR/PSD ubiquitination ramps right after training activity; transient deubiquitination should stabilize synapses and speed consolidation. Target activation of this to occur about 5 minutes after training or exposure. However, if the rate-limiting step sits in the first few minutes between trials, boosting deubiquitination during the first half of each ITI should let you shorten optimal spacing, like in the middle of each 10 minute gap between exposures.

USA, 99, 14500-14505 -- "The kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) play essential roles in receptor transportation along the microtubules. KIF17 transports the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit in vitro, but its role in vivo is unknown. To clarify this role, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing KIF17 tagged with GFP. The KIF17 transgenic mice exhibited enhanced learning and memory in a series of behavioral tasks, up-regulated NR2B expression with the potential involvement of a transcriptional factor, the cAMP-dependent response element-binding protein, and increased phosphorylation of the cAMP-dependent response element-binding protein. Our results suggest that the motor protein KIF17 contributes to neuronal events required for learning and memory by trafficking fundamental N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors."

"α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors functionally coupled with NMDA receptors are other popular targets in the studies on memory strengthening. Chemical activation of AMPA receptors by ampakines (benzamides, benzothiadiazines, biaryl propylsulfonamides, 3-trifluoromethylpyrazoles) have been found to facilitate memory (for detailed review, see [10]). AMPA receptors are regulated by the protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ), a product of the PKCζ gene in the brain, that has been shown to affect the long-term memory storage in invertebrates and vertebrates (see review [11]). For example, overexpression of PKMζ in the rat neocortex enhanced long-term memory, whereas the dominant negative PKMζ with amino acid substitution in the active site disrupted memory [12]. In monkeys, higher levels of PKMζ were associated with more accurate recognition memory [13]. "

"Another popular target in the memory improvement studies is cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor that regulates expression of immediate early genes, such as c-Fos and zif268. In general, any manipulation that that leads to the upregulation of CREB expression results in memory enhancement. To give a few examples, local overexpression of CREB in the basolateral amygdala enhanced memory in the classic fear conditioning [14] and social defeat [15] tests. Overexpression of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV) that directly regulates CREB in the forebrain of mice improved memory in the social recognition and Morris water maze tests [16, 17]. CCAAT/enhancerbinding protein (C/EBP), a product of the early C/EBP gene, is involved in the activation of late response genes in synaptic plasticity. Upregulation of C/EBP expression enhances memory performance. Thus, suppression of the negative C/EBP regulator, ATF4, improved performance of the experimental animals in the Morris water maze test [18]."

"Among many attempts to find chemical agents potentiating CREB-mediated pathways, the most productive approach to memory enhancement in AD patients involved modulation of phosphodiesterase (PDE) that negatively regulates the cAMP/CREB pathway by hydrolyzing cAMP. Hence, PDE inhibitors should enhance memory. Indeed, some PDE inhibitors, namely Rolipram and Sildenafil, have shown positive result in AD mouse models. Cilostazol a selective inhibitor of PDE3, partially prevents cognitive decline and memory loss in AD patients [19]. For more detailed information on the inhibitors on CREB-dependent pathways, see the review [20]."

[Memory in aged mice is rescued by enhanced expression of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3540206/)

"adult Nr3a KO mice were reported to have increased pain sensation and enhanced abilities in learning and memory tasks ([Mohamad et al., 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3630778/))." -- "Using wild-type (WT) and GluN3A knockout (KO) mice, we show here that deletion of GluN3A affected multiple behavioural functions in adult animals. GluN3A KO mice showed impaired locomotor activity on a variety of motor function tests, and increased sensitivity to acute and sub-acute inflammatory pain. GluN3A KO mice also showed enhanced recognition and spatial learning and memory functions. Hippocampal slices from juvenile and adult GluN3A KO mice showed greater long-term potentiation (LTP) compared with WT slices. GluN3A deletion resulted in increased expression of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) in the forebrain, and the phosphorylated CaMKII level upon LTP induction was significantly higher in the GluN3A KO hippocampus compared with WT controls. CaMKII inhibition abrogated the enhanced LTP in GluN3A KO slices."

"The <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3630778/">enhancement of learning and memory in GluN3A KO mice is similar to that seen in the 'smart mice' overexpressing GluN2B (NR2B</a>; Tang et al. 1999). GluN2B, however, has been identified as a pro-death NMDAR subunit (Liu et al. 2007), whereas deletion or downregulation of GluN3A in the adult brain does not increase the risk of excitotoxicity or ischaemic injury (Nakanishi et al. 2009). In this respect, GluN3A appears to be a more realistic target for learning and memory modulation than GluN2B. To this end, the role of GluN3A in adult behaviour should be confirmed with conditional GluN3A manipulation studies."

Here, we studied the effects of long-term α1AAR stimulation using transgenic mice engineered to express a constitutively active mutant (CAM) form of the α1AAR. CAM-α1AAR mice showed enhancements in several behavioral models of learning and memory. In contrast, mice that have the α1AAR gene knocked out displayed poor cognitive function. Hippocampal brain slices from CAM-α1AAR mice demonstrated increased basal synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation, and long-term potentiation compared with wild-type (WT) mice. WT mice treated with the α1AAR-selective agonist cirazoline also showed enhanced cognitive functions. In addition, CAM-α1AAR mice exhibited antidepressant and less anxious phenotypes in several behavioral tests compared with WT mice. Furthermore, the lifespan of CAM-α1AAR mice was 10% longer than that of WT mice. Our results suggest that long-term α1AAR stimulation improves synaptic plasticity, cognitive function, mood, and longevity."

in transgenic mice, stabilized beta-catenin causes markedly enlarged brains with increased cortical surface area and even sulci/gyri–like folds.

beta-catenin expression: [Regulation of cerebral cortical size by control of cell cycle exit in neural precursors](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12130776/) -- "Transgenic mice expressing a stabilized beta-catenin in neural precursors develop enlarged brains with increased cerebral cortical surface area and folds resembling sulci and gyri of higher mammals. [...] Compared with wild-type precursors, a greater proportion of transgenic precursors reenter the cell cycle after mitosis. These results show that beta-catenin can function in the decision of precursors to proliferate or differentiate during mammalian neuronal development and suggest that beta-catenin can regulate cerebral cortical size by controlling the generation of neural precursor cells."

We identify 56 genes preferentially expressed in human apical and basal radial glia that lack mouse orthologs. Among these, ARHGAP11B has the highest degree of radial glia-specific expression. ARHGAP11B arose from partial duplication of ARHGAP11A (which encodes a Rho guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein) on the human lineage after separation from the chimpanzee lineage. Expression of ARHGAP11B in embryonic mouse neocortex promotes basal progenitor generation and self-renewal and can increase cortical plate area and induce gyrification.

To investigate whether G1 lengthening alone may cause the switch of cortical progenitors from proliferation to neurogenesis, we manipulated the expression of cdk/cyclin complexes and found that cdk4/cyclinD1 overexpression prevents G1 lengthening without affecting cell growth, cleavage plane, or cell cycle synchrony with interkinetic nuclear migration. Specifically, overexpression of cdk4/cyclinD1 inhibited neurogenesis while increasing the generation and expansion of basal (intermediate) progenitors, resulting in a thicker subventricular zone and larger surface area of the postnatal cortex originating from cdk4/cyclinD1-transfected progenitors. Conversely, lengthening of G1 by cdk4/cyclinD1-RNAi displayed the opposite effects. Thus, G1 lengthening is necessary and sufficient to switch neural progenitors to neurogenesis, and overexpression of cdk4/cyclinD1 can be used to increase progenitor expansion and, perhaps, cortical surface area."

BDNF transgenic mice provided the opportunity to investigate the effects of modestly increased BDNF levels on dendrite structure in the complex in vivo environment. While the elevated BDNF levels were insufficient to change levels of TrkB receptor isoforms or downstream TrkB signaling, they did increase dendrite complexity of dentate granule cells. These cells showed an increased number of first order dendrites, of total dendritic length and of total number of branch points. These results suggest that dendrite structure of granule cells is tightly regulated and is sensitive to modest increases in levels of BDNF.

By 21 days post-mitosis, exogenous neuroligin-1 was expressed at the tips of dendritic spines and increased the number of dendritic spines. Neuroligin-1-overexpressing cells showed a selective increase in functional excitatory synapses and connection multiplicity by single afferent fibers, as well as an increase in the synaptic AMPA/NMDA receptor ratio. In contrast to its synapse-inducing ability in vitro, neuroligin-1 overexpression did not induce precocious synapse formation in adult-born neurons. However, the dendrites of neuroligin-1-overexpressing cells did have more thin protrusions during an early period of dendritic outgrowth, suggesting enhanced filopodium formation or stabilization. Our results indicate that neuroligin-1 expression selectively increases the degree, but not the onset, of excitatory synapse formation in adult-born neurons."

## Enhancement by knockout of memory suppressor genes

Some knockouts confer a cognitive benefit. See "<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(21)00576-6">memory suppressor genes</a>".

[NSG2 knockout](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13041-024-01158-7): Knockout of AMPA receptor binding protein Neuron-specific gene 2 (NSG2) enhances associative learning and cognitive flexibility. "To date, most gene deletions shown to enhance cognitive ability generally affect a limited number of pathways such as NMDA receptor- and translation-dependent plasticity, or GABA receptor- and potassium channel-mediated inhibition. While endolysosomal trafficking of AMPA receptors is a critical mediator of synaptic plasticity, mutations in genes that affect AMPAR trafficking either have no effect or are deleterious for synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. NSG2 is one of the three-member family of Neuron-specific genes (NSG1-3), which have been shown to regulate endolysosomal trafficking of a number of proteins critical for neuronal function, including AMPAR subunits (GluA1-2) ... NSG2 KO animals demonstrated enhanced recall in the Morris water maze, accelerated reversal learning in a touch-screen task, and accelerated acquisition and enhanced recall on a trace fear conditioning task. Together, these data point to a specific involvement of NSG2 on multiple types of associative learning, and expand the repertoire of pathways that can be targeted for cognitive enhancement." NSG2 regulates endolysosomal trafficking of AMPAR subunits (GluA1/2); its loss probably shifts AMPAR handling to favor stronger associative encoding and easier updating. It probably tweaks the balance of LTP/LTD and/or receptor recycling/endocytosis. The paper emphasizes this is unexpected given prior AMPAR-traffic mutants often hurt plasticity. If you don't want to knockout NSG2, then consider point mutations to blunt NSG2-GluA1/2 interaction, or disrupt dileucine/tyrosine-based motifs to bias NSG2 away from AMPAR trafficking.

Other knockout targets:

* PAIP2A inhibits translation during memory consolidation. Consider conditional knockout or heterozygote.
* FKBP12 inhibits mTOR-Raptor complex and has protein synthesis dependent effects on consolidation. Systemic loss will effect many tissues, so this must only be a conditional knockout in forebrain.
* GABRA5 (GABAA receptor subunit α5) is a suppressor of acquisition.
* GAT1 (Slc6a1) reduces GABA reuptake; heterozygotes for GAT1 show better performance across tasks.
* Caspase-2 stabilizes AMPAR endocytosis and promotes forgetting.
* PIWIL1/2 provides small RNA silencing which impedes LTM. Make the change via dual knockdown in adult hippocampus only.
* KCNH3 (Kv12.2) potassium channel loss-of-function: previously discussed on this page.
* [NCX2 knockout](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273%2803%2900334-9.pdf)

There are a few other options but they have higher pleiotropy or system-wide effects (doesn't mean they are unusable just requires more thoughtfulness):

* eIF2α-kinases (PKR, GCN2; PERK only if tightly restricted): reduced eIF2α phosphorylation, lowered L-LTP threshold, enhanced hippocampal memory. ([x](https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-7-43))
* ATF4 / ICER (CREB repressors) are suppressors of memory consolidation
* inhibit Rac1 after learning rather than as a germline knockout
* STEP (PTPN5)
* HDAC2
* Cdk5

Other mutations (which reduce functionality in a favorable way) to consider instead of knockout:

* eIF2α S51A heterozygote: "Mice with phosphorylation-deficient eIF2α display enhanced spatial memory, fear memory, taste memory, and elevated late-phase LTP (L-LTP) (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007). Phosphorylation of eIF2α suppresses memory formation via two distinct mechanisms. First, eIF2-dependent production of memory-supporting proteins is decreased (Boye and Grallert, 2020). Second, the translation of the CREB inhibitor ATF4 is increased (Lu et al., 2004; Vattem and Wek, 2004). The memory suppressor genes PKR, GCN2, and PERK all code for kinases that phosphorylate eIF2α at the S51 residue, thereby suppressing eIF2α-dependent consolidation and synaptic plasticity (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2005; Sharma et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2011)." (<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(21)00576-6">ref</a>)
* PDE4D catalytic hypomorph: partial loss of PDE4D activity raises cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling during consolidation. PDE4 inhibitors and KOs consistently enhance LTM. Hypomorphic or regulatory-domain mutations mimic pharmacologic effects without systemic toxicity.
* FKBP12-mTOR interface mutant: weakening FKBP12 binding to mTOR removes a brake on translation-dependent memory consolidation. Ensure calcineurin binding remains intact.
* enhanced sensory temporal acuity and temporal coding in auditory midbrain via Kv3.1 mutant

## Injection and infusion

fetal microinjection of FGF2 into embryonic ventricles (mouse E11.5) induces cortical gyrification ([Cortical gyrification induced by fibroblast growth factor 2 in the mouse brain](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3693057/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) -- "Gyrification allows an expanded cortex with greater functionality to fit into a smaller cranium. However, the mechanisms of gyrus formation have been elusive. We show that ventricular injection of FGF2 protein at embryonic day 11.5—before neurogenesis and before the formation of intrahemispheric axonal connections—altered the overall size and shape of the cortex and induced the formation of prominent, bilateral gyri and sulci in the rostrolateral neocortex. We show increased tangential growth of the rostral ventricular zone (VZ) but decreased Wnt3a and Lef1 expression in the cortical hem and adjacent hippocampal promordium and consequent impaired growth of the caudal cortical primordium, including the hippocampus. At the same time, we observed ectopic Er81 expression, increased proliferation of Tbr2-expressing (Tbr2+) intermediate neuronal progenitors (INPs), and elevated Tbr1+ neurogenesis in the regions that undergo gyrification, indicating region-specific actions of FGF2 on the VZ and subventricular zone (SVZ). However, the relative number of basal radial glia—recently proposed to be important in gyrification—appeared to be unchanged. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased radial unit production together with rapid SVZ growth and heightened localized neurogenesis can cause cortical gyrification in lissencephalic species. These data also suggest that the position of cortical gyri can be molecularly specified in mice. In contrast, a different ligand, FGF8b, elicited surface area expansion throughout the cortical primordium but no gyrification. Our findings demonstrate that individual members of the diverse Fgf gene family differentially regulate global as well as regional cortical growth rates while maintaining cortical layer structure."

[Estradiol mediates fluctuation in hippocampal synapse density during the estrous cycle in the adult rat](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/12/7/2549.full.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) -- "We have found that the density of synapses in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 region in the adult female rat is sensitive to estradiol manipulation and fluctuates naturally as the levels of ovarian steroids vary during the 5 day estrous cycle. In both cases, low levels of estradiol are correlated with lower synapse density, while high estradiol levels are correlated with a higher density of synapses. These synaptic changes occur very rapidly in that within approximately 24 hr between the proestrus and estrus stages of the estrous cycle, we observe a 32% decrease in the density of hippocampal synapses. Synapse density then appears to cycle back to proestrus values over a period of several days. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such short-term steroid-mediated synaptic plasticity occurring naturally in the adult mammalian brain." and another study [suggests](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2021-76265-001) that endogenous hippocampus estradiol not peripheral estradiol is responsible for female rat "novel object recognition" skill, however they only tested this via inhibition of the production of hippocampal estradiol via microinjection of letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) into the hippocampi of rats.

* injection of chondroitinase ABC for the purposes of digesting or loosening the perineuronal net, or otherwise allowing ECM flexibility, to re-enable some level of juvenile synaptic plasticity. ChABC cleaves the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of CSPGs in the PNN, reducing their inhibitory effect. This loosens or dismantles the PNN structure, allowing more synaptic remodeling and axonal sprouting. The removal of CSPG inhibition reduces signaling through PTPσ and NgR1, decreasing RhoA activity and cytoskeletal stabilization, and promotes increased TrkB signaling and BDNF sensitivity. Pharmacological or genetic reduction of CSPG synthesis (e.g., targeting aggrecan or link proteins) can also achieve a similar effect as chondroitinase ABC treatment. Otx2 is a transcription factor that stabilizes PNNs around parvalbumin neurons and a reduction of Otx2 might be able to destablize PNN.

* various cell cycle control factors either genomically encoded and expressed, or via intracortical injection
* injection of kalirin-7 (a regulator of spine plasticity)

* faster action potentials. faster recovery. more dendrites per neuron. more receptors per synapse (davidad says estimates are 150 to 300 receptors per human synapse), less ubiquitin, more DUB, more basal radial glia cells.

faster action potentials:

* Kv3 channel mechanisms: Kv3.1/3.2 enable ultra-fast action potential [repolarization](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4922457/?utm_source=chatgpt.com); transfection/overexpression of Kv3.1 makes normally slow neurons capable of high-rate firing.
* BK channel β4 (KCNMB4) loss narrows action potentials and alters excitability in dentate granule cells

need to double check and confirm these mouse results:

* overexpression of neuronal caveolin-1 (SynCav1) to increase dendritic arborization and synaptic preservation in aging mice?
* Cdk4 + Cyclin-D1: increasing expression of these cell-cycle genes in adult dentate gyrus expands neural stem/progenitor pools, increases adult neurogenesis, and improves memory.
* TLX (Nr2e1, orphan nuclear receptor): TLX expression expands adult hippocampal stem/progenitor cells (increased AHN) and has been linked to enhanced learning/memory in mice.

other TODO to consider:

* Hyperactive MFN1: engineered Mfn1 variant that weakens GTPase-helix-bundle autoinhibitory contacts while preserving HR2 coiled-coil integrity, aiming to shift the conformational equilibrium toward the fusion-competent state and enhance mitochondrial network elongation.
* Cleavage-biased OPA1: An OPA1 mutant with selectively blunted OMA1-sensitive cleavage (rather than completely cleavage-dead) via local loop and charge edits around the S1 site, to favor long-form OPA1, stabilize cristae structure, and improve respiratory efficiency.


possibly it would be better to focus on the engineering of entire systems of growth and pruning rather than just growth, unless existing pruning mechanisms can accommodate irrelevant-needs-to-be-pruned overgrowth. It is not clear if there is a specific balance or synaptic plasticity rate, or synaptogenesis rate to pruning rate etc, that needs to be hit in order to have significantly improved cognitive ability or learning.

CCR5-delta32 mutation may improve memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity. FDA-approved CCR5 antagonists (maraviroc, vicriviroc, cenicriviroc, leronlimab) may also be sufficient for this and do not require germline genetic engineering. It is unclear if baseline mice or baseline human experience cognitive improvements from genetic CCR5-delta32 mutation or even pharmacological antagonism. This was previously discussed in public with regards to the Jiankui He lab and the three germline modified human embryos with speculation that the chosen target was also chosen for its potential cognitive benefits.


Overexpressing Tet1S (short isoform, lacking large N-terminal regulatory regions) supports memory formation, while full-length Tet1 overexpression restricts memory formation.  Global Tet1 knockout enhanced hippocampal-depenendent memory but this is possibly because it included the knockout of full-length Tet1. However, the catalytic domain alone disrupts DNA demethylation programs and therefore impairs synaptic plasticity. Earlier Tet1 memory studies did not distinguish between different Tet1 isoforms? The short isoform of Tet1 called Tet1S lacks most of the repressive N-terminal domain, it's associated with activity-dependent demethylation, and promotes rapid transcriptional induction of plasticity genes. More broadly, Tet1 regulates memory by controlling the epigenetic permissiveness of activity-dependent plasticity genes through DNA demethylation and therefore changes gene expression patterns required for synaptic plasticity. Depending on which Tet1 isoform or domain is manipulated, Tet1 can either enhance or impair memory because the full-length form is partly repressive, while the short isoform is pro-plasticity.

### Amphetamine-related enhancement

The following ideas are based on the concept of tracing the mechanism of action of amphetamine with regards to amphetamine-linked cognitive benefits.

idea: increase expression of D1 receptor in layer II/III + V mPFC pyramidal neurons.

idea: increase α2A receptor mediated inhibition of cAMP in pyramidal neurons.

### Nicotine-related enhancement

The following ideas are based on the concept of tracing the mechanism of action of nicotine with regards to nicotine-linked cognitive benefits.

idea: Knock-in a mutant α4 subunit (Chrna4) with increased agonist sensitivity, expressed specifically in layer V/II-III mPFC pyramidal neurons. α4β2 is the main high-affinity nAChR in PFC; low nicotine doses preferentially act here and enhance attention/working memory. Stronger/longer α4β2 activation would lead to more depolarization + more M-current suppression and therefore higher persistent firing during tasks. Also, point mutations in nAChR subunits are well-characterized.

idea: overexpression of α4 and β2 subunits in pyramidal neurons of mPFC and hippocampus to increase receptor density, therefore producing larger nicotinic currents for endogenous ACh, resulting in stronger gain modulation of excitatory cells. Cognitive enhancement from nicotine is strongest in circuits rich in α4β2; more receptors should amplify endogenous cholinergic tone.

idea: α7 (Chrna7) overexpression in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. α7 is heavily implicated in LTP and episodic/recognition memory; α7 agonists can mimic aspects of nicotine’s memory enhancement.

idea: knock-in an α7 variant with increased Ca2+ permeability or slower desensitization, restricted to CA1/CA3 pyramidal neurons. Avoid excitotoxicity somehow.

idea: overexpress α5 (Chrna5) in α4β2-containing receptors on layer V mPFC pyramidal neurons.

idea: overexpress α4/β2 selectively in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.

idea: α4β2 overexpression targeted to presynaptic glutamatergic terminals in hippocampus. Presynaptic restriction can be tricky compared to these other ideas.

idea: overexpress both α4β2 nAChRs and dopamine D1 receptors in PFC pyramidal neurons.



### Astrocyte-specific changes (speculative)

Here are some astrocyte-specific modifications that might be beneficial:

* optimize glutamate uptake dynamics. Targets for this in astrocytes would include EAAT2/GLT-1 (Slc1a2) and EAAT1/GLAST (Slc1a3). GLT-1 overexpression in astrocytes. Increase glutamate transporter expression. Or modestly treat kinetic properties of the glutamate transporter.
* enhance potassium buffering. Overexpression of Kir4.1 (KCNJ10) in astrocytes. Increase membrane expression. Modify gating kinetic. Enhance trafficking.
* astrocyte-specific MCT1 overexpression (as mentioned elsewhere on this page). Lactate export can be targeted by targeting MCT1 (SLC16A1) and MCT4 (SLC16A3). Shift LDH-A to favor lactate. GLUT1 for glucose uptake at astrocyte endfeet. Mild tweaks of trafficking signals to bias them into perisynaptic processes. (Astrocyte-derived lactate is linked to memory formation; more efficient lactate supply could support energetically expensive phases of LTP.)
* improve mitochondria or PGC-1α associated mitochondrial biogenesis in astrocytes
* increase astrocyte neurotrophic factor support by placing cDNA for BDNF, GDNF, thrombospondins (TSP1/2), hevin (SPARCL1) under an astrocyte-specific promoter. Some mutational work could be done to alter receptor specificity or increase protein stability in extracellular space. There are also astrocyte-expressed synapse maturation factors (Hevin (SPARCL1), SPARC, glypican-4, glypican-6) that could be overexpressed, or otherwise modified for altered binding properties to synaptic partners (e.g., neurexin/neuroligin bridging by hevin).
* improve handling of oxidative stress in astrocytes to protect synapses from ROS, via overexpression or more of several antioxidant enzymes (SOD2 (mitochondrial superoxide dismutase), catalase, mitochondrial catalase, glutathione-related enzymes (GCLC, GCLM, GPx, etc.)).
* enhance regulation of extracellular adenosine via overexpression of CD39 (ENTPD1), CD73 (NT5E), or ENT1/2 (equilibrative nucleoside transporters). Increase their catalytic efficiency or surface localization. These changes alter the time course of adenosine buildup and clearance.
* enhance targeting of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) to the astrocytic endfeet (perivascular localization), such as via α-syntrophin interaction stabilization. The goal is to prevent depolarization of the aquaporin-4 channels and make clearance more efficient per hour of sleep. It is not clear to me whether a benefit would exist regardless of the outcome of the general theory of sleep related glymphatic clearance system.

### Inspired by oxygen supplementation therapy

Normobaric oxygen supplementation in humans improves scores on psychometric testing. Inspired by this (and the high altitude modifications elsewhere on this page), here are several changes to consider.

* [Mitochondria-targeted catalase (MCAT) overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3676474/): make a better human catalase targeted to the mitochondria inside neurons. Improved catalase also has a pro-longevity effect (see elsewhere on this page). probably something to do with redox signaling. It might interfere with adaptive metabolism due to less ROS. Some ROS signaling triggers kinases in neurons? etc. Higher catalase is associated with lower self-reports of depression symptoms. MCAT overexpression also correlated with longevity, downregulates oxidative damage.
* [neuroglobin overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5996123/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) has a neuroprotective effect against intermittent hypoxia (in mice).
* idea: Astrocyte-specific MCT1 overexpression (e.g., GFAP- or Aldh1l1-driven) to increase lactate efflux capacity. Astrocytes store glycogen and export L-lactate via MCT1 (SLC16A1). Neurons import lactate mainly via MCT2, oxidize it to pyruvate, and feed the TCA cycle. Late-phase LTP is ATP-hungry. Lactate can also trigger plasticity pathways. However, too much astrocyte generated lactate without matched neuronal uptake (via MCT2, PDH) might cause acid damage.
* idea: Neuron-specific MCT2 overexpression. MCT2 (SLC16A7) is the high-affinity neuronal lactate transporter; its expression tracks synaptic density and plasticity. Increases lactate capture from astrocyte supplied lactate. This should help with LTP consolidation. Consider redox state with respect to swings in pyruvate/lactate ratio.
* idea: add myoglobin to neurons.
* idea: add cytoglobin to astrocytes.
* idea: Neuron-biased SOD1 up-tuning under an activity/ROS-responsive promoter (e.g., ARE or c-fos/NRF2 hybrid), so antioxidant capacity scales with demand. But you also don't want to over-dampen ROS signaling. Mis-timed SOD1 could shift redox to H2O2 burden unless downstream peroxidases/catalase can keep up, so maybe use the MCAT overexpression too.
* idea: add G6PD overexpression to neurons. G6PD is the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, generating NADPH for glutathione/peroxiredoxin systems and supporting biosynthesis during plasticity. Extra NADPH headroom supports rapid glutathione recycling during learning, limiting ROS-induced synaptic instability. Supports de novo synthesis (lipids, nucleotides) relevant to spine remodeling and local protein synthesis. Glycolsis might be impacted by this?
* idea: brain-endothelial-restricted PHD2 hypomorph to slightly raise HIF activity locally, thereby promoting angiogenesis and better-perfused capillary networks.

## Tweaked synaptic plasticity

Tweak or partially destabilize postsynaptic protein complexes to allow for more synaptic plasticity or synaptic remodeling of receptors etc. For example: "[FRMPD2 (FERM and PDZ domain containing 2)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11463660/) encodes a scaffold protein that participates in cell-cell junction and polarization, localized at photoreceptor synapses and the postsynaptic membrane in hippocampal neurons in mice. A partial duplication of the ancestral FRMPD2 created the 5’-truncated FRMPD2B paralog ~2.3 mya. FRMPD2B encodes 320 aa of the C-terminus, versus 1,284 aa for the ancestral, maintaining two of three PDZ domains involved in protein binding but lacking the KIND and FERM domains. Ancestral FRMPD2 expresses in the human prenatal cortex during upper layer formation, while FRMPD2B is evident postnatally. The paralogs also show divergent evolutionary signatures, with FRMPD2 strongly conserved and FRMPD2B exhibiting possible positive selection. Combined, we propose a model in which truncated human-specific FRMPD2B counteracts the function of full-length FRMPD2 leading to altered synaptic features in humans, possibly through interactions of its PDZ2 domain with GluN2A of NMDA receptors at the postsynaptic terminal. Its postnatal expression would avoid the detrimental effects of inhibiting FRMPD2 during early fetal development (i.e., microcephaly). We note that recurrent deletions and duplications in chromosome 10q11.21q11.23 impact both paralogs in children with intellectual disability, autism, and epilepsy. FRMPD2B could plausibly contribute to the upregulation of glutamate signaling and increased synaptic plasticity observed in human brains compared with other primates that is fundamental to learning and memory."

speculation: Based on that proposed FRMPD2B model above, FRMPD2B increases synaptic plasticity in the postnatal brain by acting as a dominant-negative regulator of the ancestral FRMPD2 scaffold protein at glutamatergic synapses. The truncated FRMPD2B retains two PDZ domains, including PDZ2 which can bind to GluN2A subunits of NMDA receptors, but lacks the N-terminal KIND and FERM domains that enable full-length FRMPD2 to properly organize and stabilize postsynaptic protein complexes. When FRMPD2B competes with full-length FRMPD2 for binding sites at the postsynaptic density, it likely disrupts the normal scaffolding function that would otherwise constrain synaptic architecture and receptor organization. This competitive inhibition could destabilize rigid postsynaptic assemblies, allowing for more dynamic NMDA receptor trafficking, enhanced receptor mobility, and reduced constraints on synaptic remodeling. This frees the NMDA receptors to diffuse laterally, possibly reduces anchoring to F-actin, and favors a switch from GluN2B- to GluN2A-dominant NMDA currents that lowers the threshold for calcium-dependent CaMKII/CREB signaling and AMPA receptor phosphorylation, thereby potentiating long-term synaptic potentiation and in aggregate increases the heightened postnatal plasticity characteristic of the human brain. The resulting increase in glutamate receptor availability and synaptic structural flexibility would facilitate activity-dependent strengthening and weakening of synapses. By expressing only postnatally, FRMPD2B avoids interfering with FRMPD2's essential roles in early cortical development while specifically modulating synaptic plasticity during the critical period of postnatal synapse refinement and circuit maturation when human cognitive abilities develop.

Other approaches to tweak postsynaptic protein complex stability include [increasing ABHD17 or decreasing zDHHC2 to nudge PSD-95 palmitoylation](https://elifesciences.org/articles/11306) which controls its clustering and AMPAR anchoring; modestly increasing depalmitoylation (e.g., ABHD17A/B/C) shrinks PSD-95 nanoclusters and increases remodeling, yet leaves the scaffold intact.

Or, alternatively, AMPAR anchoring hinges on stargazin/TARP C-tail binding to PSD-95 PDZs. Mild disruption (short PDZ-ligand peptide or phospho-mimic C-tail) increases AMPAR lateral diffusion and turnover.

[Disruption of stargazin-PSD-95](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627307000712) increases AMPAR diffusion and that PDZ-ligand phosphorylation modulates this coupling.

Alternatively, brief [chondroitinase ABC](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0602657103) (or related strategies) reopens critical-period-like plasticity in adult cortex, such as to loosen the extracellular perineuronal net or extracellular matrix.

## Prolonged NMDA receptor phosphorylation

idea: intentionally prolong NMDA receptor phosphorylation or otherwise have control over increasing NMDA receptor phosphorylation. This should should: (i) increase channel activity and Ca2+ influx, (ii) keep more NMDARs at synapses by suppressing endocytosis, and (iii) bias plasticity thresholds toward potentiation. However, you also don't want to chronically suppress LTD.

STEP inhibition to sustain GluN2B phosphorylation: The goal is to maintain tyrosine phosphorylation of GluN2B at Y1472 to increase synaptic NMDAR stability and Ca2+ signaling. The neuron-specific phosphatase STEP (PTPN5) dephosphorylates GluN2B-Y1472, promoting receptor endocytosis. Inhibiting STEP prolongs phosphorylation, keeping NMDARs at the surface. Use TC-2153, a selective STEP inhibitor shown to restore learning and synaptic function. You can possibly target excitatory neurons using CaMKIIα-CreERT2.

PKA activation during learning windows: Boost PKA-dependent phosphorylation of NMDAR NR1 subunits (e.g., S897), enhancing receptor trafficking and Ca2+ currents only during training or learning periods. Gs-coupled signaling activates adenylyl cyclase, then cAMP, then PKA, which phosphorylates NR1, increasing NMDAR surface delivery and open probability. One chemogenetic approach is to express Gs-DREADDs (designer Gs-coupled receptors) under a CaMKIIα promoter; administer ligand (CNO or equivalent) just before behavioral training. Pair learning with natural β-adrenergic or dopaminergic bursts: brief noradrenaline or dopamine surges known to facilitate LTP induction.

Local activation of Src/Fyn kinases at the PSD: Increase tyrosine phosphorylation of GluN2B (Y1472) and GluN2A to potentiate NMDAR currents and facilitate synaptic plasticity. Src-family kinases (Fyn, Src) phosphorylate NMDARs and PSD-95, strengthening receptor function. Overactivation is harmful. One option is optogenetic recruitment of Fyn to synapses. Another option is chemically inducible dimerization to transiently localize Fyn to PSDs. Increasing Reelin or EphB signaling will also recruit Src/Fyn to synapses and increase NMDA phosphorylation.  Elsewhere on this page we discuss the possibility of direct injection of Reelin into the cortex for enhanced learning.

Pair behavioral training with brief LC (locus coeruleus) or VTA optogenetic activation, or timed low-dose β-AR (β-adrenergic receptor, a G-protein-coupled membrane receptor that binds norepinephrine/epinephrine and activates cAMP signaling to mediate arousal, memory, and synaptic plasticity) or D1 receptor (D1R) agonists (such as SKF-38393, SKF-82958, A-77636, and apomorphine (partial)). Restrict stimulation to minutes during learning tasks to mimic physiological reinforcement signals. See this [review on benzazepine D1 agonists](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.806618/full).


## Gain of function proposals for specific neuron proteins

NR2B / GRIN2B (GluN2B; NMDAR subunit): Raise synaptic abundance/surface residency (e.g., boost forward transport or recycling), modestly bias open probability/deactivation toward longer currents, or preserve PDZ-anchoring to keep NR2B at spines.

KIF17 (kinesin-2 motor for NR2B cargo): Increase motor-cargo interaction or expression to elevate NR2B delivery; consider domain designs that favor spine-targeted drop-off. Maybe a dimerization design to transport more NR2B cargo to synapses? Amplify its ability to traffic NMDA receptor subunits, particularly NR2B/GRIN2B, to dendritic spines and synapses, thereby enhancing synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance. One strong concept is to increase KIF17-cargo coupling by engineering or stabilizing its interaction with NR2B-containing vesicles through optimized tail or adaptor domains, ensuring more efficient receptor delivery to the postsynaptic membrane. Another is to boost motor processivity or run length by modifying its motor domain or coiled-coil regions, allowing KIF17 to transport cargo more persistently along microtubules. Enhanced spine-targeting motifs could improve the precision of cargo delivery to active synapses. Various kinesin motors have been improved in the literature too: [ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9871336/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [processivity run length](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11086010/), [dimerization](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3992690/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), increase processivity by [shortening long neck linkers](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2882250/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), etc. Exploit subunit composition (head identity) because KIF3B is the more processive head. Increase [landing rate](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-025-01630-5).

SNX27 (endosomal recycling adaptor with PDZ domain): discussed below.

Kv3.1 / KCNC1 (fast-spiking interneuron K+ channel): Boost PV-cell channel density or slightly speed gating; keep cell-type specificity to avoid dampening pyramidal excitability. Consider excitability/inhibitory balance issues.

Reelin: A compact multivalent R3-R6 "mini-Reelin", optionally fused to the C-terminal region (CTR), could maximize ApoER2/VLDLR clustering and downstream Dab1 signaling with greater efficiency than the full protein. Engineering cleavage-resistant or pre-cleaved variants would extend the half-life or diffusion of active fragments, maintaining higher local signaling levels. Oligomerization modules at the N-terminus could ensure receptor clustering even at low concentrations, while ECM-anchoring or mild heparan-binding tags would confine activity to perisynaptic zones that mediate plasticity. Additional refinements: ApoER2-biased mutations, optimized RGD presentation for integrin co-activation. [ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1891246/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

USP46: focus on stabilizing its active conformation and targeting its deubiquitinase activity to synaptic substrates that support learning and memory. Constructing a pre-assembled USP46–UAF1–WDR20 complex (for example, through single-chain or fusion designs) could lock the enzyme in its fully active, allosterically enhanced state, bypassing the need for cofactor availability. Adding synaptic localization motifs, such as short targeting sequences or receptor-binding peptides, would increase local enzyme concentration at postsynaptic AMPA receptor nanodomains or inhibitory synapses. Engineering substrate-selector fusions could bias USP46 toward specific receptor subunits, enhancing recycling rather than degradation, and loop-stabilized or allosterically active variants could further raise catalytic efficiency.

### SNX27

[Overexpression of SNX27](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.595357/full) / Rab11-axis to raise recycling flux back to the membrane. -- "Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) is an endosomal adaptor protein associated with a variety of nervous system diseases, and it is mainly responsible for the trafficking of postsynaptic membrane receptors. Here, we first generated a neuron-specific human-SNX27 transgenic mouse model (hSNX27 Tg) that exhibited enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition, we found that the hSNX27 Tg mice displayed enhanced learning and memory, lower-level anxiety-like behavior, and increased social interaction. SNX27 overexpression promotes synaptic function and cognition through modulating glutamate receptors."

SNX27 boosts LTP mostly by recycling PDZ-motif cargos (e.g., GluA1) from endosomes back to the surface, in cooperation with retromer (VPS26/29/35) and activity-coupled K-Ras/CaM signaling. To achieve SNX27 gain of function, generally one should target: increase cargo affinity/avidity (PDZ), increase retromer coupling (between β3–β4 hairpin and VPS26), increase endosomal residency/targeting (PX), increase activity gating (RA/CaM/K-Ras), increase lifetime/concentration (stability/oligomerization).

1) Dimerization of SNX27. Multivalency is a classic way to boost capture/recycling for trafficking adaptors without altering their specificity. Simply increasing the number of PDZ pockets that sample the same endosomal surface usually increases effective on-rate and lowers apparent off-rate. This change should cause boost to PDZ-cargo capture (AMPARs, neuroligins) and hand-off to retromer.

2) Strengthen the natural PDZ-retromer allostery (β3-β4 hairpin and VPS26 interface tuning). Target here is better cargo affinity and faster sorting into retromer tubules.

3) Make the PDZ pocket electrostatically "sticky" at the rim via small charge tweaks around a peptide-binding groove to favor typical PDZ-motif flanks.

Several other protein changes are possible for SNX27 of course.

Note that for overexpression of either receptors in neurons or modulated expression, either upregulated or downregulated, in any neuron can have different performance and behavioral outcomes depending on the region or type of neuron in which this different gene expression program is executed. It may be interesting to look at transcription factors and synthetic transcription factors or other promoters that are cell type specific or cell fate specific in order to get a specific effect in a specific type of neuron or in specific circuits. Likewise, modulated expression in every cell throughout the body is likely non-ideal.

## Other speculative intelligence enhancements via transgenic/germline

### Reasoning: Increase projections between left RLPFC and IPC

White matter tract cross-sectional width betwen left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (left RLPFC) and IPC (inferior parietal cortex) predicts reasoning ability or intelligence. Increase the number of projections or axons to increase intelligence.

#### RLPFC neurodevelopment background context

Axon pathfinding for long-range cortico-cortical afferent fibers proceeds through the intermediate zone/subplate which is a transient waiting compartment that hosts early synaptogenesis and guides corticocortical afferents. The subplate serves as a fetal/adolescent waiting comparment for these fibers.

Apical radial glia (aRG) in the ventricular zone and basal/outer radial glia (bRG/oRG) in the expanded outer SVZ generate excitatory pyramids. The oRG pool is massively expanded in primates/humans, especially in frontal cortex, and is a key source of upper-layer (II/III) SATB2+ intratelencephalic (IT) projection neurons that furnish association fibers. Intratelencephalic (IT) projection neurons are an SATB2+ excitatory pyramidal cell whose axon remains within the telencephalon to link ipsi- or contralateral cortical areas.

Developmental genetics specify projection identity: SATB2 promotes callosal/IT fate and represses CTIP2/FEZF2 (subcerebral) programs; perturbing this axis flips cortico-cortical neurons to subcortical targets in mice. Rostrolateral PFC (including BA10/RLPFC) progenitors sit under rostralizing morphogen gradients (e.g., FGF8/17; high PAX6), whereas IPL progenitors sit under relatively caudalizing gradients (e.g., EMX2/NR2F1/COUP-TFI). Early areal fate biases in these pools seed later differences in long-range connectivity. More late-born SATB2+ L2/3 IT neurons gives rise to more cortico-cortical axons available to form long association bundles like SLF II/III.

FGF8/17 (anterior organizer) and PAX6/EMX2/NR2F1 gradients set rostral–caudal cortical identity.

VZ areal enhancers mapped by the cortical regionalization TF network (CRTFN) can bias expression to rostral vs caudal progenitor pools; recent work even dissects Nr2f1 (COUP-TFI) enhancer modules with distinct regional functions. Pairing these with excitatory-lineage drivers lets you confine manipulations to RLPFC or IPL pools that ultimately seed SLF II/III partners.

oRG cells are self-renewing asymmetric progenitors such that a single oRG cell can produce multiple downstream cells over its lifetime before terminal differentiation. This only expands the late-born excitatory neuron pool, a subset of which will become SLF II/III neurons depending on areal fate.

#### Approaches

Here are several different ideas for how one might increase the density of intratelencephalic projections between left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal cortex:

* expand the basal/outer radial glia progenitor pool to produce more late-born upper-layer (II/III; L2/L3) SATB2+ intratelencephalic (IT) projection neurons.
* bias the arealization of the expanded oRG progenitor pool towards SLF II/III fate.
* lengthen neurogenesis or add extra oRG/IP divisions by manipulating cell-cycle regulators (e.g., Cdk4/cyclin D1, p27^kip1^, Tbr2/Eomes timing), Notch and FGF signaling, which maintain oRG self-renewal, or transcriptional temporal identity programs (e.g., Hmga2, Zbtb20). Studies have extended neurogenesis artificially (like Pilaz et al., Neuron 2009; Nonaka-Kinoshita et al., Cell Reports 2013 (prolonged neurogenesis by Hmga2 modulation)) by altering these pathways, leading to extra upper-layer neuron production. p27Kip1 downregulation has a similar effect as the cyclin D1 and cyclin E2 overexpression for G1 duration shortening. FGF2/FGF8/FGF17 gradients maintain self-renewal in rostral progenitors. Notch and Wnt sustain oRG cycling; BMP antagonism favors neurogenic vs. gliogenic outcomes. SHH contributes to SVZ proliferation in outer zones.

[Forced G1-phase reduction alters mode of division, neuron number, and laminar phenotype in the cerebral cortex](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0909894106) -- forced a ~25 % shortening of TG1 (G1 duration) by overexpressing Cyclin D1 + Cyclin E1 in embryonic cortical progenitors, and observed enhanced progenitor self-renewal at the expense of differentiation, resulting in increased basal progenitor pools and later "supernumerary supragranular neuron production".

### Bilateral anterior capsulotomy and IQ enhancement

#### Background

In certain cases of treatment resistant obsessive compulsive disorder, a surgical procedure is able to increase IQ by about 5 to 10 IQ points through a bilateral anterior capsulotomy procedure.

Bilateral (both hemispheres) anterior capsulotomy is a lesioning procedure of the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC)) The internal capsule is a dense sheet of white matter carrying projection fibers between the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei (especially the thalamus, basal ganglia, and brainstem). The anterior limb lies between the head of the caudate nucleus (medially) and the lentiform nucleus (laterally).

Within this region run fronto-thalamic and fronto-striatal fibers, key components of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loops implicated in mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive circuits.

Overactivity of OFC-MD-striatum circuits is reduced. Also lesions the fibers between the anterior cingulate and thalamus, which dampens the pathological overdrive of emotional-motivational signaling. Rigid overcontrol and maladaptive habit reinforcement is reduced by lesioning the projections through ALIC to the head of the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens for the prefrontal-striatal fibers. Fibers from thalamic nuclei (esp. MD and anterior nucleus) ascend through the same region to prefrontal areas. Lesioning the capsule affects both descending (corticofugal) and ascending (thalamocortical) communication, dampening bidirectional overactivation.

These are corticofugal neurons that are destined during development for the internal capsule, instead of SLF or callosal. The progenitors are radial glia of the rostral dorsal pallium under FGF8, SP8, FEZF2 influence. The guidance profile includes DCC, Neuropilin-1, Robo1. These are not intratelencephalic neurons (like for SLF II/III). They share the same early corridor (IZ/IC) but diverge because their transcriptional programs encode opposite guidance receptor repertoires.

While corticofugal axons descend, thalamocortical axons grow upward through the internal capsule from diencephalic progenitors (Gbx2+, Lhx2+, Otx2+ lineages). Corticofugal axons provide scaffolds and guidance cues (e.g. L1CAM, NCAM, Netrin) for thalamic axons. Thalamic axons express complementary receptors (DCC, TAG-1, Robo1/2) and pause until the cortical plate matures.

When the ascending MD -> PFC thalamocortical fibers are interrupted in a capsulotomy: The mediodorsal thalamus loses direct excitatory access to OFC/ACC/PFC. That means fewer thalamic relay signals reinforcing emotional salience or intrusive self-referential loops. Functionally, it decreases the "gain" of the recurrent cortico-thalamo-cortical amplifier.

The fibers lesioned in bilateral anterior capsulotomy come from a deep, early corticofugal lineage whose axons (and their thalamic reciprocals) occupy the anterior limb of the internal capsule.
They are developmentally and molecularly distinct from the later-born associative (SLF, callosal) tracts that share the intermediate zone transiently but express opposite transcriptional and guidance signatures. By cutting both descending and ascending members of this fronto-thalamo-striatal system, the surgery functionally disinhibits cognitive networks and reduces affective interference, sometimes manifesting as improved cognitive clarity or apparent increases in measured IQ.

#### Approach

Here's a developmental-genetic strategy to reduce fronto-thalamo-striatal connectivity either by programming fewer corticofugal projection neurons during embryogenesis or by installing an optogenetic "soft lesion" capability for postnatal functional silencing. During corticogenesis, transcriptional regulators (FEZF2, CTIP2, TBR1) specify the subcerebral projection neuron identity in deep-layer progenitors; modulating their dosage, timing, or downstream effectors (e.g., DCC, Robo1, Neuropilin-1 expression levels) could systematically reduce the number of ALIC-destined neurons born from rostral dorsal pallium radial glia, thereby genetically "pre-lesioning" the pathway.

Alternatively, these same projection neurons could be tagged during development with a cell-type-specific promoter driving expression of inhibitory opsins (eNpHR, GtACR) or chemogenetic receptors (hM4Di), enabling selective, reversible silencing of the corticofugal limb (and indirectly weakening the thalamocortical return loop) on demand, recapitulating the functional disinhibition and cognitive enhancement observed after surgical capsulotomy without permanent tissue damage.

Both approaches (genomic reduction of pathway neuron number or optogenetic functional suppression) would exploit the developmental lineage specificity and guidance-receptor signatures that distinguish internal-capsule projection neurons from associative cortical circuits, offering a molecularly precise, genetically encoded equivalent of the therapeutic lesion.

### General cognitive improvement

Core theory: Intelligent, abstract reasoning emerges from a hierarchically-nested cortical oscillatory architecture in which brief, symbol-carrying γ-bursts (30–100 Hz) are phase-locked to the trough of any available slow rhythm, such as θ (4–8 Hz) during active maintenance, δ (1–4 Hz) during rest or deep reasoning, or even α (8–13 Hz) during anticipatory coding. Meanwhile, β-oscillations (13–30 Hz) broadcast from prefrontal–basal-ganglia–thalamic loops to hold or update the current task set. Superior capacity therefore requires (i) sharp, PV-interneuron-governed γ packets that can nest inside whichever slow carrier is dominant, (ii) resilient slow clocks (septal/hippocampal θ, thalamic δ, or occipital α) that preserve phase consistency, (iii) switch-ready β desynchronization, and (iv) myelin-optimized long-range tracts that keep multi-area phase-lags constant across the slow-fast pairings in play. Any intervention that tightens this flexible slow→γ nesting (δ/θ/α–γ) while preserving rapid re-nesting yields measurable gains in working-memory span, reasoning speed, and abstract depth.

Superior cognitive capacity depends on four biological ingredients: sharply timed gamma packets sculpted by parvalbumin-positive interneurons that fit snugly inside the dominant slow wave; steady phase relationships in the slow clocks themselves across time; beta rhythm desynchronization when the task set needs to change; and heavily myelinated long-range fibers maintaining fixed phase lags among distant areas so that slow-fast coupling remains coherent.

Various proposals for general cognitive improvement:

* enhancement of Kv3.1/3.2 potassium in fast-spiking PV+ interneurons channels plus low-dose brain-wide cholinergic agonism (e.g., chronic low-dose donepezil or galantamine). Kv3 up-regulation speeds repolarization in *all* fast-spiking neurons, so every local cortical column sharpens its γ bursts and tightens spike timing, while diffuse cholinergic tone globally elevates γ propensity and θ–γ PAC. Some issues here with phase alignment vs amplitude, homeostatic pushback, and cholinergic bluntness of the agonism.
* or, instead: PV-targeted Kv3 up-tuning (Cre-dependent), SST phase-tuning (HCN/M-current), a mild, activity-dependent myelination bias, and receptor-specific pro-γ tweaks (e.g., α7 nAChR up-bias) instead of global AChE inhibition; together these could lift γ and improve θ–γ–β nesting.

#### Significantly increase working memory capacity

With non-trivial cell engineering and protein engineering, it may be possible to get biological working memory capacity of 7 +- 2 items to increase towards 20 or 30 items.

Working memory capacity can be theoretically expanded by interventions that (1) tighten cross-frequency coupling precision, (2) stabilize inter-areal phase timing, (3) speed β gating dynamics, and (4) enlarge representational dimensionality.

### Increase compatibility with a cognitive pacemaker

What is a cognitive pacemaker? A cognitive pacemaker is a closed-loop, phase-locked neuromodulation system designed to stabilize and optimize the brain’s intrinsic oscillatory dynamics across distributed cortical–subcortical networks. It functions like an electronic phase-locked loop (PLL) that continuously measures the phase and amplitude of endogenous slow rhythms. These endogenous slow rhythms include δ (1–4 Hz) during rest, θ (4–8 Hz) for working memory and sequencing, α (8–13 Hz) for anticipatory coding, and β (13–30 Hz) for task-set maintenance. The cognitive pacemaker then delivers precisely timed stimulation bursts that reinforce coherent γ-band (30–100 Hz) “packets” generated by parvalbumin-positive interneuron networks. By maintaining phase alignment between slow “carrier” rhythms and fast γ events across prefrontal, hippocampal, thalamic, and basal-ganglia circuits, the pacemaker can enhance communication-through-coherence and improve cognitive throughput, memory encoding, and attentional stability. Technologically, it integrates high-resolution EEG/MEG or iEEG sensing, low-latency digital phase detection and prediction, and isolated current drivers (for tACS, tTIS, TMS, tFUS, DBS, or optogenetic stimulation) that inject micro-stimulation at specific phase angles of the ongoing rhythm while avoiding artifact and charge buildup. Its PLL-style controller tracks and predicts oscillatory phase in real time, adjusts for conduction delays, and modulates stimulation frequency, amplitude, or phase offset according to brain state. Because neural oscillations underlie not only cognition but also pathological synchrony, the same architecture could suppress epileptiform bursts, normalize β hyper-synchrony in Parkinson's or depression, promote δ–σ coordination in sleep, or transiently boost θ–γ coupling for reasoning and learning. In essence, a cognitive pacemaker is a general-purpose, adaptive timing interface between biophysics and computation and it's an engineered feedback system that restores or enhances the brain's hierarchical rhythm structure without overwriting its natural dynamics.

It is possible to build a cognitive pacemaker using closed-loop stimulation with EEG and/or intracortical EEG and a stimulation strategy. However, the benefits of a cognitive pacemaker could be extended through germline intervention such as by encoding optogenetics into the genome.

It is not clear which aspects of oscillatory waves in the human brain are byproducts versus which aspects are causative. Depolarization of neurons at a certain timestep might be able to faster prepare neurons for incoming spikes at a rate faster than the rate at which natural cellular pacemakers in the brain are able to orchestrate the ensembles. That's just one example where a cognitive pacemaker might be able to help. Another example use case for a "cognitive pacemaker" is for shortening, aborting, predicting, modulating or eliminating epileptic seizures. A cognitive pacemaker might come in handy if other tweaks are made to the brain that might have a chance of causing seizures or epilepsy. This kind of device might also be able to assist with more restful sleep, lucid dreaming, perception, semantic encoding, reward training, etc.

Here are several modifications that might be able to improve the performance or integration of a cognitive pacemaker:

Each of these could be tested via CRISPR in mice by introducing: a promoter duplication for ADK (upregulate or otherwise promote expression); a single-point mutation in Adora2a or Adora1 disrupting G-protein coupling; a gain-of-function allele in Slc29a1 (ENT1); a stabilized complex I subunit (e.g., Ndufs4) mimicking tighter coupling; or a nonsense mutation in Ptgds." .... it also says: "A microdeletion affecting the 5' regulatory region or a non-critical exon of ADK might lead to a benign, inherited suppression of sleep pressure, causing minimal systemic disruption while significantly reducing brain adenosine accumulation." but I thought adenosine kinase was used everywhere? maybe not?

well we could just optogenetically inhibit various mu opioid receptors or neurons in nucleus acumbens.

Various operant conditioning and classical conditioning tasks have been achieved by direct optogenetic activation or inhibition of neurons in the nucleus accumbens or striatum neurons. Encoding these optogenetic receptors into the germline could enable greater real-time control over learning, motivational circuits, etc.

## Brain uploading (prepatory)

### Full connectome recording via synaptic barcoding and its in vivo reconstruction

Summary: Use RNA barcodes inside neurons and synapses such that at the synapse two RNA neurons are combined. Later the structure of the connectome can be extracted by DNA sequencing. By encoding this into the genome, the number of neurons or synapses that get tagged this way can be vastly improved compared to AAV delivery of connectome-seq genomic material.

Cell [[lineage tracing]] and barcoding techniques like brainbow, [[MAPseq ("Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing")|mapseq]], the [[in situ sequencing]] variant BARseq, or [Connectome-seq](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.13.638129v2.abstract) use genetic programs to decorate neurons and synapses throughout the brain so that the connectivity (connectome) can be recovered by DNA sequencing instead of electron microscopy [[brain imaging]] for [[brain uploading]]. To some extent this is often achieved by lentivral or AAV delivery of genetic payload into adult brain to target some of the neurons. intraparenchymal delivery of AAV is undoubtedly helpful for this. However the information is, at this time, only recovered postmortem. (In fact, it is plausible that postmortem AAV or microinjection may (for a short period of time postmortem) be able to do some amount of barcoding). Future versions might be able to emit SYNseq or synaptic barcoding information via exosome export of DNA or something.. but for now it is a postmortem procedure.

Germline compared to AAV synaptic cartography can achieve significantly better distribution and coverage (namely 100% coverage) of cells and neurons in the brain can be achieved via germline genetic engineering of brainbow-style or synaptic barcoding schemes. The effect of this is to grow a human brain that is "extra prepared" for brain uploading via DNA sequencing as opposed to requiring neural anatomy reconstruction via scanning electron microscopy.

In the future it may be possible to deliver genomically encoded full neural network topology information such that a molecular biology program can [reconstruct the original neuronal topology or connectome](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6511037/). See also <https://gnusha.org/logs/2025-09-30.log> for more speculation about what this kind of multi-cellular genetic program would require. It very likely would be in vitro neural circuit reconstruction long before it is ever in vivo human reconstruction... if ever.

### Other speculative neuronal enhancements to assist with brain uploading

These are mostly fanciful ideas that should be validated in an animal model first.

Organelle- or compartment-specific tags (e.g. mitochondria, dendritic spines, axon terminals): Improve automated segmentation by giving EM-visible landmarks or fluorescent anchors.

Membrane-tethered reporters: Aid in delineating neuronal boundaries for optical microscopy or electron microscopy.

EM-detectable tags (e.g. APEX2, miniSOG, HRP-fusion proteins): Enable correlative light and electron microscopy, helping bridge genetic labeling with ultrastructural reconstruction.

Add various GFP or fluorescent indicators to neurons. Fluorescent voltage indicators and other fluorescent indicators are available.

Use the oscillatory waves cell identity visualization trick and couple it to barcoding information somehow.

DNA ticker tape memory for calcium spike recording, action potential spike recording, or intracellular protein recorders. Needs to be coupled with cellular export into bloodstream, or maybe only activate it shortly before death. It is unclear what level of information can be recorded or retrieved from this. Similarly with the fluorescent indicators, it may not be wise to express them throughout life and instead wait to activate them until later or maybe during cell death programs.

Various genomically encoded nanobodies can be expressed for antibody-based tagging and staining.

Consider anything that would help with postmortem [[expansion microscopy]] for [[brain imaging]].

review [PRISM](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.26.678648v1) for any other changes that would be beneficial to genomically encode, such as their GFP-fused "protein bits" that space-fill each neuron with a random neural barcode driven by Cre-lox (or polylox barcoding or CRISPR-based barcoding) lineage randomization. It would be interesting if the "protein bits" could be combined with [connectome-seq](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.13.638129v2.abstract) migration of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic RNA barcodes into the synaptic junction for connectome recovery via sequencing. The combination could be achieved, possibly, by having some sort of relationship between the RNA barcode and the abstract bit-vector from the set of "protein bits" expressed by that neuron.

# Longevity

[Dsup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dsup) from tardigrades for chromatin/DNA radiation resistance, and also for longevity via impeding mitochondrial respiration and lowering ROS damage.

[Tardigrade Dsup extends C. elegans life span by impeding mitochondrial respiration and promoting oxidative stress resistance](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx9669) -- tardigrade Ramazzottius varieornatus damage suppressor (Dsup) gene when expressed in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans caused tolerance to "x-ray exposure and oxidative stress without apparent toxicity and exhibited a notable extension of life span. This effect was independent of the canonical DAF-2/DAF-16 longevity pathway and mitochondrial dynamics. Instead, Dsup expression markedly reduced mitochondrial respiration, providing a plausible mechanism for enhanced oxidative stress resistance and extended longevity." Dsup is largely unstructured but binds nucleosomes to shield DNA from damage. Dsup binding causes chromatin compaction and chromatin condensation, which affects transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, causing a reduced expression of respiratory chain components, lower oxygen consumption (decreased mitochondrial respiration), and therefore cuasing less electron transport (meaning fewer reactive oxygen species). Probably transcription factors or histone chaperones or other processes, using ATP etc, are trivially able to bypass Dsup on the chromatin and get access to the actual genetic material when needed. Dsup binds to chromatin and DNA, but not so strongly that it never dissociates.

Here is where Dsup could be useful in human biology:

* Oocytes and mature eggs: Reproductive germ cells experience chronic low-level oxidative stress and have relatively low basal metabolic rates compared to somatic tissues. Dsup could shield their DNA from age-related damage, potentially preserving fertility and embryonic viability, similar to its protective role in tardigrade anhydrobiosis.
* Resting or quiescent stem cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow): These cells rely on glycolysis more than oxidative phosphorylation for energy during dormancy and are vulnerable to ROS-induced mutations. Mild mitochondrial suppression by Dsup might promote self-renewal and longevity while reducing mutagenic risk, without compromising their occasional bursts of activity.
* Astrocytes
* avoid use of Dsup in cardiac myocytes, skeletal fast-twitch muscle fibers, cortical or hippocampal neurons, hepatocytes, spermatocytes, or other cells that have high energy demands.

ApoE is a lipid-binding apolipoprotein that transports cholesterol and other lipids. In the brain ApoE is the principal cholesterol carrier, moving lipids from astrocytes to neurons via LDL-receptor-family receptors; in peripheral tissues it mediates lipoprotein clearance and cholesterol metabolism.

* Various frameshift indels in TET2 and DNMT3A, and high levels of granulocytes in blood. "Both TET2 and DNMT3A are factors [28,29] and are thought to silence hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal to permit efficient hematopoietic differentiation [30,31]. Therefore, loss of functionality in these genes is likely to underlie an enhanced self-renewal leading to the observed age-related myeloid lineage bias. This skewing towards the myeloid lineage is assumed to have adverse effects on immune functionality in normal healthy individuals, but in the oldest old the increase of the myeloid compartment might be compensative for the age-related decrease in naive T-cells, known as immuno-senescence. Hence on condition that the enhanced self-renewal, instigated by somatic disruptive mutations in TET2 and DNMT3A, leads to increased levels of competent immune cells, be it of the myeloid lineage though, might partly compensate for the age-related loss of immuno-capacity of the lymphoid compartment."

(CETP is a lipid shuttle glycoprotein that moves cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between lipoproteins. CETP is structured as an elongated, hydrophobic tunnel, allowing it to bind and transfer neutral lipids. CETP influences HDL levels, lipid exchange, and reverse cholesterol transport.) CETP 405V/V is associated with a favorable lipid profile (higher HDL, larger lipoproteins, downregulation of CETP). However, the benefits of CETP I405V might be [Ashkenazi-only](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1c36/681e48b8e8860e9e5be3617b7d524679e6dc.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com). This might be a statistical artifact in the analysis pointing to CETP I405V or it might be due to the Ashkenazi lipoprotein phenotype (unusually large HDL and LDL particles, higher apoA-I levels, higher HDL2b fraction (bouyant HDL), low triglyceride-rich remnant burden, lower prevalence of small dense LDL). But in other populations (with higher triglycerides, more insulin resistance, or more small dense LDL), turning down or reducing CETP may worsen lipoprotein remodeling pathways such as by impeding reverse cholesterol transport, and CETP inhibition in that lipid context might produce dysfunctional HDL or impair cholesterol efflux.

[IF1 overexpression](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.28.466310v4) ([blog post](https://medium.com/@Michael_Forrest/attacking-cancers-achilles-heel-immortality-and-possibly-gifting-us-all-a-longer-life-1e030ec1735c)) based on the concept of F1F0‑ATP‑hydrolysis as a heat production engine across species: Species with higher IF1 expression per unit mass inhibit more ATP‑hydrolysis, produce less heat, have lower sBMR, lower ROS and therefore live longer. Also consider other ATP hydrolysis inhibitors. Cancer cells exploit the ATP‑hydrolysis‑driven proton‑leak to maintain a hyper‑polarised mitochondrial membrane that supports the Warburg phenotype. Selective inhibition of hydrolysis therefore hits cancer metabolism without harming normal cells which can compensate with ambient heat. Consider a shorter but still functional human IF1 protein fragment using residues 42-58 and using a mitochondrial import sequence, and also a cell penetrating peptide sequence. There are also small molecule selective F1F0‑ATP‑hydrolysis inhibitors. Another idea is to make a gain-of-function IF1 protein mutant that is pH-insensitive that provides more hydrolysis blocking. Selective delivery of IF1 protein to mitochondria (or a better mitochondrial import sequence?). The paper argues that combating ROS generation (by throttling the ATP‑hydrolysis heat engine) is a more powerful and safer way to lower ROS than trying to mop up ROS after they form. Cosmetical or dermal delivery of IF1 peptide can provide localized inhibition which may significantly reduce ROS in the skin (where photo-damage is abundant) without affecting whole‑body temperature. Possibly useful to target to specific tissues genomically instead of whole body? ROS is merely a symptom and excess heat‑producing ATP hydrolysis is the source of the damage. ([IF1 structure and slop](https://diyhpl.us/~bryan/irc/chatgpt/if1-longevity.txt))

Some other IF1 gain of function mutations to consider: reduce N‑terminal proteolysis by matrix peptidases; increase rigidity and reduce unfolding‑induced proteolysis; more resistance to denaturation; fusion to a mitochondrial‑stable scaffold (e.g., COX8A‑targeting peptide + sfGFP) to make it less prone to aggregation; increase long-term stability. Multiple pH insensitivity mutations are possible. Add tandem repeat core to increase number of inhibitory helices. Multimerization, trimerization or dimerization via leucine‑zipper trimer fused to IF1-core? Use an antibody or nanobody to increase binding affinity to a ride-along target? "covalent dimer via split-intein after mitochondrial import" nah... Better mitochondrial targeting sequence or mitochondrial import sequence. Better cell penetrating peptide sequence. tether to a mitochondrial chaperonin?

Both DNP (dinitrophenol) and IF1 protein influence the mitochondrial proton gradient, but DNP does it by adding a non‑specific proton conduit, whereas IF1 acts as a brake on the reverse activity of ATP synthase. Consequently, DNP raises basal metabolism, while IF1 lowers basal metabolism.

Improve memory in aging via [conditional ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) knockout in aged brain](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00940-z) or a FTL1 hypomorph or FTL1 +/- het. This knockout improves memory in aged brain. Elevated neuronal ferritin‑light chain (FTL1) in the aged hippocampus drives cognitive decline by disturbing iron homeostasis and downstream metabolic competence. Age‑related up‑regulation of FTL1 increases the pool of oxidized (Fe3+) labile iron, which impairs mitochondrial electron‑transport efficiency and lowers proton‑motive‑force‑driven ATP synthesis. The resulting ATP shortfall compromises the expression and trafficking of synaptic proteins (e.g., PSD95, NMDA‑R, AMPA‑R, synapsin) and reduces both excitatory and inhibitory synapse density, leading to weakened long‑term potentiation and memory deficits. Knocking out FTL1 restores the Fe3+/Fe2+ balance, re‑activates oxidative‑phosphorylation genes (Sdhb, Atp5 subunits, Ndufa10), rescues mitochondrial ATP production, and reinstates synaptic protein levels and synapse numbers, thereby normalising hippocampal plasticity and improving performance. FTL1 inhibition ameliorates age‑associated cognitive impairment by correcting iron‑induced metabolic dysfunction and revitalising synaptic integrity.

<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(23)01163-4">GNAQ gain of function significantly improves memory in aging</a> mice, worms and neurons. -- "The cAMP element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor, whose expression and function decline with age, activates the plasticity mechanisms necessary for long-term memory consolidation in vertebrates and invertebrates. Activation of CREB through rejuvenation methods, such as exercise and parabiosis, or CREB overexpression, improves synaptic plasticity and memory with age. EGL-30/Gαq is a guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) subunit α (Gαq) that regulates pre-synaptic transmission and other neuronal functions in C. elegans. Its constitutive activation (EGL-30 [Q205L and V180M]) extends memory through activation of CREB. Like EGL-30(Q205L), the constitutively active form of the highly conserved mammalian GNAQ(Q209L) leads to reduced GTPase activity and continued activation of downstream Gαq signaling. Therefore, we wondered if Gnaq(gf), like egl-30(gf), could improve memory and slow cognitive decline in aged mammals and, if so, whether the downstream molecular mechanisms are similarly well conserved across species. We found that the analogous activating mutation in GNAQ rejuvenates memory in very old mice through well-conserved neuronal molecular mechanisms."

[yamanaka OSKM gene therapy improves hippocampal memory in aged brain](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-024-01269-y) - maybe express these factors linked to an in vivo aging sensor? or systemic administration activation?

## Mammals

Many of the following longevity interventions or results are from studies of transgenic mice.

GH/IGF signaling & nutrient sensing:

* IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) haploinsufficiency (Igf1r+/-), longevity effect especially strong in female [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12483226/)
* consider other insulin/IGF receptor mutations, like lowering IGF1R signaling to de-repress FOXO, or age-gated IGF1 or IGF1R so that there is high IGF1 signaling in early life, and low IGF signaling later in advanced age (reduced cancer and improved stress resistance). Most of the benefit will probably come from late-life IGF1R reduction or IGF1 signaling reduction.
* idea: IGF1R deficiency can be mimicked by something like, say, hyperactive SOCS1 gain-of-function allele responsive to accumulating senescent cell signals (via SASP cytokines) to preserve IGF1 receptor activity for early fitness while triggering receptor degradation in advanced age to boost FOXO/DAF-16 nuclear activity and lifespan extension.
* idea: maybe a mutation in PTP1B to tie its enhanced dephosphorylation of IGF1R to age-related telomere shortening via a telomeric repeat-binding factor interaction, maintaining early-life growth signaling but progressively inhibiting it for late-life stress resistance.
* growth hormone receptor knockout (GHRKO) ("Laron" model)  [Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1474-9726.2009.00520.x?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* IRS1 knockout (Irs1-/-), sex-biased though [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17928362/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* S6K1 knockout (S6k1-/-; mTOR axis) ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4954603/)), especially strong effect in females [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19797661/); Rps6kb1 knockout. This mimics a selective block of the mTORC1-S6k1 axis, which is a major target of rapamycin. Results from [hepatic S6k1 deletion](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5585733/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) indicates partial contribution of liver S6K1 to whole-body aging.
* AKT1 haploinsufficiency (Akt1+/-), longer lifespan with metabolic shifts related to mTOR and autophagy [PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0069178&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* FGF21 transgenic overexpression, lifespan extension via GH/IGF modulation [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466591/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), or [adipocyte-specific FGF21](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131%2825%2900267-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

sirtuins & stress response:

* SIRT6 overexpression (whole-body), also shown to reduce frailty in B6 mice. [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10815?utm_source=chatgpt.com); Also consider using SIRT6 from whale instead.
* use a [human centenarian SIRT6 variant](https://portlandpress.com/neuronalsignal/article/5/2/NS20200101/228755/Exploiting-the-neuroprotective-effects-of-klotho?utm_source=chatgpt.com) with increased double-strand break repair and LINE-1 suppression ([SIRT6 N308K and A313S](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embj.2021110393))
* brain-specific SIRT1 overexpression (BRASTO mice), increase median and max lifespans, via hypothalamic mechanism [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24011076/). SRT2104 is a SIRT1 activator in clinical trial. SIRT1 deacetylates FOXO3, p53, PGC-1α, NF-κB, etc., generally shifting cells toward stress resistance, mitochondrial biogenesis, and lower inflammatory tone. It interacts with AMPK (mutual activation) and indirectly influences mTOR signaling through nutrient-sensing pathways. Chronically cranking SIRT1 with high NAD+ might have trade-offs (e.g. interplay with PARP1 and DNA repair). Besides SIRT1 activation, hyperactivating FOXO3 deacetylation can be achieved by stimulating other HDACs like HDAC3 that target FOXO3 or inhibiting acetyltransferases such as p300/CBP to reduce FOXO3 acetylation.
* [LINE1 repression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6519963/) (i don't understand this?)
* what happened to "Sirtis Pharmaceuticals" anyway?

oxidative stress & mitochondria:

* mitochondrial catalase transgenic (MCAT), increase of median and max lifespan, downregulates oxidative damage. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15879174/)
* selegiline (L-deprenyl) is an irreversible, selective MAO-B inhibitor whose longevity-relevant biology is mostly about lowering mitochondria-derived oxidative stress and switching on pro-survival gene programs (antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and neurotrophic. Knoll rat experiments reported [lifespan extension with chronic low-dose deprenyl](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3126392/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40816452/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). [reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/158f63m/how_would_you_describe_the_effects_of_selegiline/jt9y9l0/).
* MAOB expression rises with age, but is this a cause or an effect or both?
* selegiline expression where, everywhere? or certain localized tissues?
* reminder that phenylethylamine+selegiline is essentially meth (combo TAAR1 agonist plus MOA-B antagonist) and should be approached with extreme caution

KLOTHO:

* KLOTHO overexpression (KlTg): improved lifespan, endocrine effects on insulin/IGF signaling. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16123266/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* possibly you want [KLOTHO heterozygosity](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247%2814%2900287-3?utm_source=chatgpt.com)?

Klotho acts like a systemic longevity hormone, regulating mineral metabolism, oxidative stress, and multiple growth pathways. Klotho directly influences phosphate homeostasis by acting as an obligate co-receptor for fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), facilitating its binding to the FGFR1c receptor to activate downstream ERK signaling that suppresses renal phosphate reabsorption via downregulation of NaPi-IIa cotransporters and inhibits 1α-hydroxylase to reduce active vitamin D synthesis. Overexpression of Klotho influences FGF23 / phosphate / vitamin D homeostasis, insulin/IGF1 and Wnt signaling, and oxidative stress resistance and some autophagy/proteostasis pathways.

Alternative ideas instead of specifically targeting or overexpressing Klotho:

* gain-of-function mutation in the FGFR1c receptor that enhances its affinity for FGF23 independently of Klotho, thereby activating ERK signaling to suppress renal phosphate reabsorption and vitamin D synthesis, mimicking Klotho's endocrine effects on mineral homeostasis.
* overexpress a constitutively active form of ERK1/2 specifically in renal proximal tubule cells to directly downregulate NaPi-IIa cotransporters and 1α-hydroxylase, replicating Klotho's phosphate-lowering without relying on the Klotho-FGF23 co-receptor complex.
* alterations in the insulin/IGF1 receptor pathway, such as a dominant-negative IRS-1 variant, to attenuate downstream PI3K/Akt signaling and enhance longevity through reduced anabolic signaling, paralleling Klotho's inhibitory effects on insulin/IGF pathways via alternative endocrine modulation.

Myc & growth control:

* reduced Myc expression (haploinsufficiency): longer healthy lifespan with broad protection [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3494070/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* [Telomerase (TERT) overexpression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19013273/?utm_source=chatgpt.com): delayed aging and increased longevity without extra cancer in treated cohorts (AAV gene therapy of wildtype mice in this study) [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23066506/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* TERT overexpression in cancer-resistant mice (extra tumor suppressors) delays aging and extends lifespan ([ref](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/s0092-8674%2808%2901191-4))
* idea: a mutation increasing TERT's stability by disrupting ubiquitin-mediated degradation signals would prolong telomerase half-life, ensuring sustained telomere maintenance during organismal aging without risking oncogenic overactivity.
* idea: engineer a variant in TERT's RNA-binding motif to improve affinity for TERC, boost holoenzyme assembly and activity.
* idea: a mutation altering TERT's nuclear import signals to enhance localization efficiency might increase telomerase availability at chromosome ends.

## Strategies for engineered negligible senescence

Aubrey de Grey proposed "Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence" which includes the following:

<https://sens.org/>

[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence](https://www.lifespan.io/our-research/intro-to-sens-research/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) is a repair-based approach to aging. It consists of seven categories of molecular and cellular damage that accumulate with age and proposes targeted adult interventions to keep their levels below the threshold that causes pathology. While SENS is primarily focused on adult aging, many of the concepts can be used to inform human germline genetic engineering for anti-aging.

* cell loss (like from non-dividing cells) and atrophy requires replacement (RepleniSens) via tissue engineering and stem cell therapies to restore cell numbers and function. Stimulation or proliferation of resident progenitors to replace lost cells.
* death-resistant (senescent) cells must be removed (ApoptoSens) via targeted ablation such as through senolytic drugs or via immune/CAR-T approaches. p16-activated caspase, senolytic small molecule therapy (dasatinib, quercetin, navitoclax), immune-mediated clearance of senescent cells (CAR-NK cells, vaccination against senescent antigens).
* extracellular aggregates require immunoclearance (AmyloSENS): use vaccination/antibody therapies to tag and remove amyloids such as Aβ or transthyretin in tissue spaces. Active or passive immunization to tag aggregates for microglia/macrophage uptake. Use catalytic monoclonal antibodies or nanobodies that enhance proteolysis. Use engineered proteases like neprilysin or MMP variants. See [neprilysin overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2768427/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Enhance endogenous clearance pathways. alagebrium (ALT-711) analogue expression during thymic negative selection.
* intracellular aggregates should be digested by better lysosomes (LysoSENS) by introducing novel lysosomal enzymes (like those sourced from microbes) to digest stubborn junk like oxidized cholesterol adducts and lipofuscin that materially clog lysosomes. Genomically encode modified enzymes with better trafficking and activity, like bacterial or fungal hydrolases. Transcriptional upregulation of TFEB (master lysosomal biogenesis factor) or TFEB overexpression. Engineer pH-optimized variants of existing lysosomal enzymes. Overexpress other autophagy/lysosomal biogenesis factors. [ATG5 overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3753544/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). [Beclin-1(Becn1) F121A knock-in](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5992097/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to boost autophagy. reverse proteotoxic pathology and lipofuscin via upregulation of lysosome and TFEB programs.
* extracellular crosslinks require the matrix to be replaced or broken (GlycoSENS) via development of crosslink-brakers (such as glucosepane) or refresh extracellular matrix to restore tissue elasticity, especially in arteries. [Glyoxalase-1 (Glo1) overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12382624/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* mitochondria DNA mutations need to be bypassed (MitoSENS) by moving mtDNA genes to the nucleus (allotopic expression) and import the proteins back into mitochondria to maintain cellular respiration. Allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes into the nucleus will require recoding for cytosolic translation and also mitochondrial targeting sequences. Mitochondrial-targeted nucleases could be used to eliminate mutant genomes. Therapeutic mitochondrial transplantation or progenitor cell transfer. Engineer enhanced mitochondrial import machinery. Add mitochondrial-targeted DNA repair systems. Overexpress mitochondrial biogenesis factors (PGC-1α, NRF1/2).
* oncogenic nuclear (epi)mutations to pre-empt cancer (OncoSENS) by the "widespread interruption of lengthening of telomeres" to prevent lethal tumor overgrowth, in addition to periodic stem cell reseeding throughout the body; CRISPR/dCas9-based targeted demethylation or histone acetylation to restore youthful gene expression; possibly some epigenetic rejuvenation via transient yamanaka-factor expression for partial reprogramming but i am skeptical. tumor-suppressor genes must not be silenced, in fact they must be unsilenced, and chromatin remodeling errors must be fixed or be made to trigger apoptosis. Immune surveillance to kill pre-cancerous cells. Engineer more robust tumor suppressor networks. Add novel DNA damage sensors and response pathways. [Super p53](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/20/1/16.long?utm_source=chatgpt.com) with added extra Ink4/Arf (s-Arf/p53 mice) produced significantly longer lifespan and delayed aging.

Some of the SENS opportunities can be met via germline engineering:

* design redundant metabolic pathways to prevent single points of failure
* create "damage-proof" protein variants less prone to aggregation/oxidation
* dramatically upregulate proteostasis networks
* engineer enhanced DNA proofreading and repair machinery, like double-strand break sensor, detection, and repair, or go into apoptosis
* look for better bacterial/archaeal DNA repair systems from other organisms
* metabolic optimization: engineer more efficient electron transport chains with less ROS production
* add alternative respiratory pathways (like those in long-lived animals)
* optimize NAD+ synthesis and utilization pathways
* engineer telomerase regulation for optimal telomere maintenance
* create enhanced stem cell reserves and regenerative capacity
* import longevity genes from extremely long-lived species (bowhead whales, Greenland sharks, naked mole rats)
* add extremophile stress resistance genes
* integrate plant/bacterial antioxidant systems
* damage-resistant proteins? metabolically optimized protein encodings?
* place "stemness" genes (PAX7, LGR5, SOX2, MYC, TERT) under endogenous or synthetic stress-inducible promoters
* maintain larger stem cell pools and create a "progenitor bias" in every tissue, possibly with FOXO3 modifications or upregulation
* probably significantly more opportunities that have long been overlooked.

## Other aging intervention

This is based on a [["how aging works"|longevity/aging-roadmap]] outline from.. many years ago.

[mitochondria-targeted catalase overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8082690/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) increases mouse lifespan and reduces age-associated oxidative damage.

[klotho knock-in](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2536606/)

something for the mTOR axis like S6k1 -/-?? ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4954603/)) -- "Caloric restriction (CR) protects against aging and disease but the mechanisms by which this affects mammalian lifespan are unclear. We show in mice that deletion of the nutrient-responsive mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway component ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (S6K1) led to increased lifespan and resistance to age-related pathologies such as bone, immune and motor dysfunction and loss of insulin sensitivity. Deletion of S6K1 induced gene expression patterns similar to those seen in CR or with pharmacological activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a conserved regulator of the metabolic response to CR. Our results demonstrate that S6K1 influences healthy mammalian lifespan, and suggest therapeutic manipulation of S6K1 and AMPK might mimic CR and provide broad protection against diseases of aging."

[Evidence for improved DNA repair in long-lived bowhead whale](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09694-5) - "bowhead whale cells exhibited enhanced DNA double-strand break repair capacity and fidelity, and lower mutation rates than cells of other mammals. We found the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein CIRBP to be highly expressed in bowhead fibroblasts and tissues. Bowhead whale CIRBP enhanced both non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair in human cells, reduced micronuclei formation, promoted DNA end protection, and stimulated end joining in vitro. CIRBP overexpression in Drosophila extended lifespan and improved resistance to irradiation. These findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that, rather than relying on additional tumour suppressor genes to prevent oncogenesis, the bowhead whale maintains genome integrity through enhanced DNA repair."

## TODO

* rapamycin informed: [hypomorphic mTOR increases longevity](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2013/08/decreased-mtor-expression-provides-20-mean-life-span-extension-in-mice/) (<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(13)00392-6">ref</a>) -- "We analyzed aging parameters using a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) hypomorphic mouse model. Mice with two hypomorphic (mTORΔ/Δ) alleles are viable but express mTOR at approximately 25% of wild-type levels. These animals demonstrate reduced mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity and exhibit an approximately 20% increase in median survival. While mTORΔ/Δ mice are smaller than wild-type mice, these animals do not demonstrate any alterations in normalized food intake, glucose homeostasis, or metabolic rate. Consistent with their increased lifespan, mTORΔ/Δ mice exhibited a reduction in a number of aging tissue biomarkers. Functional assessment suggested that, as mTORΔ/Δ mice age, they exhibit a marked functional preservation in many, but not all, organ systems. Thus, in a mammalian model, while reducing mTOR expression markedly increases overall lifespan, it affects the age-dependent decline in tissue and organ function in a segmental fashion."

Consider either deletion of IL-11 from the genome, a hypomorph mutation, heterozygosity, or simply encoding an antibody or nanobody against IL-11 to be expressed throughout life or later in life (maybe triggered by some other activator such as systemic administration or local sensing).
* endocrine niches broadcast longevity or aging signals; you don't need every cell to change, instead targeting key "broadcast" cell types can move systemic aging (fat, endothelium, hypothalamus, skeletal muscle).
* TODO: AMPK activation or overexpression needs to be studied in a mammalian model as a longevity intervention.
* TODO: chemical activators of telomerase
* TODO: calorie restriction mimetics (rapamycin, metformin, NAD⁺ precursors).

## Fertility

the following is mostly mouse science:

* [BAX knockout (-/-) causes a greater follicular endowmnet and oocyte endowment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17616717/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* [BCL-2 overexpression in oocytes increases the primordial follicular endowment by birth](https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-abstract/64/4/1153/2723396); transgenic bcl-2 mice were generated that overexpress human bcl-2 in an effort to reduce prenatal oocyte loss. The later stage follicular pruning still occurs, of course.
* [PUMA (BBC3) knockout](https://rep.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/rep/148/2/211.xml?utm_source=chatgpt.com): increases germ cell and primordial follicle numbers in embryonic and early postnatal ovaries.
* [caspase-2 knockout or inhibition](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674%2805%2900802-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com): reduces oocyte apoptosis; knockout mice show increased oocyte survival and larger ovarian reserves in experimental settings.
* increase primordial germ cells (PGCs) founder cell count via time-tuned BMP/WNT priming of the posterior epiblast. [BMP4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC316469/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) from extraembryonic ectoderm and WNT3 give epiblast cells competence to become PGCs and induce the core specifiers PRDM1/BLIMP1, PRDM14, TFAP2C. Note that [biphasic BMP4 or conditional BMP4 happloinsufficiency or Noggin expression](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07937-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com) may be necessary to preserve PGC pool size.
* [epiblast-restricted overexpression (Sox2-CreERT2) of Prdm1/Prdm14/Tfap2c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3796875/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) during the competence window should increase the fraction of cells choosing the PGC fate.
* strengthen chemoattraction, chemotaxis and survival cues during the migration and colonization phase via [KITL-KIT upregulation in gonadal ridge or along the migration path, for motility and survival](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0730719100?utm_source=chatgpt.com); gonad- or mesentery-restricted CXCL12 overexpression or boosted CXCR4 in PGCs might increase capture efficiency; improve beta1-integrin-ECM engagement via [PGC-specific ITGB1 gain-of-function or gonadal fibronectin/laminin overexpression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10079228/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Note that migration cues and integrins are pleiotropic, so it's important to use cell-type-restricted enhancers or drivers to gate these genetic programs.
* oogonia expansion and meiotic entry timing - extend the mitotic window before meiosis during fetal development: [delay STRA8 induction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42259-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com) via transient Cyp26b1 expression in the fetal ovary or oocyte-restricted dampening of RA/STRA8 signaling, which could allow for extra mitoses to occur, then there are more oogonia available to be enclosed into primordial follicles.
* oogonia expansion and meiotic entry timing - cell-cyle acceleration in oogonia: [drive CDK4/6–Cyclin D activity or lower p21/p27 in germ cells](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/35/9-10/619.full?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to increase symmetric divisions before meiotic S-phase, ideally paired with enhanced DNA repair.
* follicle assembly and perinatal survival - expand the somatic niche (pregranulosa supply) - cortical Lgr5+ pregranulosa cells (stimulated by RSPO1–WNT4–β-catenin) proliferate ([upregulate?](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7443898/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) to provide the granulosa pool. [RSPO1 overexpression or stabilized beta-catenin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655463/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in ovarian surface epithelium/Lgr5+ lineages could enlarge the scaffold that encloses more oocytes into follicles.
* follicle assembly and perinatal survival - nudge Notch to improve cyst resolution and produce more one-oocyte follicles - [oocyte JAG1 upregulation or granulosa Notch sensitization](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3968400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) might increase efficient enclosure and reduce multi-oocyte follicles or follicular atresia.
* follicle assembly and perinatal survival - [brief prepubertal YAP1 activation in pregranulosa](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6704445/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) could enlarge early follicle support without prematurely activating the pool.
* [Review: primordial pool of follicles and nest breakdown in mammalian ovaries](https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article-abstract/15/12/795/1048275) (2009)
* oocyte apoptosis occurs around fetal/perinatal life when the germline cyst breaks down and only a subset of germ cells become oocytes.
* some oocyte apoptosis is related to DNA damage such as double-strand breaks ([oocyte DNA damage checkpoint](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5621520/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), and this should probably not be blocked, except to the extent that we can upregulate DNA damage repair (although in pools of millions of oocytes it is unclear if DNA damage repair is an important component to maintaining a large supply). Trp63 (TAp63) loss or Chek2 loss protects primordial oocytes from elimination after irradiation/chemo, if you want to preserve oocytes even with damaged DNA. There might be good reasons to want to preserve mature oocytes with damaged DNA, such as for ooplasm donation or oocyte enucleaton.
* oogonia expansion and meiotic entry timing - raise DNA repair capacity to prevent checkpoint-mediated culling: BRCA1 deficiency shrinks the oocyte reserve, while RAD51 activity promotes survival. transgenic [RAD51 or BRCA1 up-tuning](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5130338/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (oocyte-restricted, perinatal) could reduce DNA damage response (DDR)-triggered losses during/leaving meiotic prophase.
* during cyst breakdown, many nurse-like germ cells die via a non-apoptotic PCD program (acidification). acidification can be blocked pharmacologically (bafilomycin/concanamycin). In mouse perinatal ovaries, many cyst sister cells behave as nurse cells and die via a non-apoptotic, lysosome/acidification-driven PCD aided by pre-granulosa cells (V-ATPase/cathepsin–dependent).
* autophagy supports oocyte survival: [germ cell–specific ATG7 knockout](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4669757/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) causes major primordial-follicle loss (primary ovarian insufficiency phenotype).
* in growing follicles, granulosa-cell apoptosis is central to atresia. Consider altering [granulosa cell apoptosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9110309/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) programs (Fas/FasL system, caspase-3).
* [evidence for non-apoptotic RCD](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2822%2900579-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (autophagy, pyroptosis, ferroptosis) in the ovary in somatic (granulosa) cells.
* CHK1-dependent elimination (checkpoint-1): CHK1 works semi-redundantly with CHK2 to cull oocytes that carry unrepaired meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In Chk2-/- neonatal ovaries, CHK1 turns on after birth and continues the culling. Inhibiting CHK1 in vitro (see LY2603618) rescues oocyte number in Chk2-/- ovaries but also slows cyst breakdown and slows primordial follicle formation.
* Hippo-YAP/TAZ controls ovarian somatic proliferation and [ovary organ scaling](https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/43/6/1074/6590289?utm_source=chatgpt.com); granulosa YAP activity promotes growth, while LATS1/2 restrain it.
* [larger ovaries and follicles via growth hormone](https://ovarianresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1757-2215-5-18?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* protect the ovary during adolescence and pre-puberty ("anti-burnout") via AMH and mTOR inhibitors and AS101 reduces "burnout" ([ref](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1620729114?utm_source=chatgpt.com)); consider low dose persistent AMH or mTOR inhibition (perhaps targeted to the ovary)
* physiologic fetal pruning needs to be aborted or mitigated somehow, possibly via S1P pathway agonism ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063448/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) or S1P pathway protection

### Artificial twinning or genetic predisposition to twinning

* (genomically encoded) AMH antibody to reduce circulating AMH such that FSH can recruit more follicles but potentially accelerating ovarian aging and accelerating menopause.
* increased ovarian sensitivity to FSH (via [SMAD3](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/pdfExtended/S0002-9297%2816%2930043-X?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (TGF-β signaling mediator which tunes the ovary's sensitivity to gonadotropin and biasing towards hyperovulation) and oocyte factors).
* dosage of [GDF9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16954162/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (oocyte-derived growth factor) and BMP15 profoundly controls ovulation rate.
* [FSHB](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/pdfExtended/S0002-9297%2816%2930043-X?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) (FSH β–subunit promoter/nearby region) variants are repeatedly associated with having dizygotic twins. Mechanistically, FSHB variants modulate circulating FSH and menstrual-cycle dynamics, plausibly increasing the chance of multiple dominant follicles and therefore two ovulations in one cycle.

[Monozygotic twinning rates are increased when the zona pellucida is thinned/breached](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7962440/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) or with specific culture conditions (such as [blastocyst culture](https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282%2810%2902960-2/fulltext?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [other conditions](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10643723/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), pointing to abnormal hatching or delayed splitting as triggers. This ties the mechanism to blastocyst dynamics and zona integrity, not to known maternal alleles. There is also a [mechanical method for splitting the human embryo into two separate monozygotic embryos](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/2/156/2527545) from a published study in the the 1990s that a research society censored and demanded that all research data be deleted. oh also he resigned :(.

### Fertility goals

* increase fertility
* ovarian hypertrophy, larger ovaries
* more oocytes, more eggs, more primordial follicles, enhanced ovarian reserves, more activated follicles
* more oocyte survival during gestation and pre-pubertal culling
* better DNA DSB repair inside oocytes
* extra ovaries, supernumerary ovaries, access ovaries
* more mature oocytes even with some amount of DNA DSBs or other problems, to use the mature eggs for oocyte donation, ooplasm donation, or oocyte enucleation
* enable further germline genetic engineering
* deliver young mitochondria to aging oocytes, or otherwise optimize mitochondria for 50+ years of support in a cell-cycle-arrested oocyte.
* minimize follicular atrophy, hypoxia, or oxidative stress

### TODO

* somehow cause a pool of mitotically-active oogonial stem cells to survive and persist throughout life (prevent meiotic entry, maintain pluripotency, suppress further differentiation cues, interfere with basement-membrane assembly to keep germ cell nests open and not compartmentalized by follicles, engineer somatic ovarian stroma to express GDNF (glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor) and CXCL12 (two niche factors that maintain spermatogonial stem cells in mammalian testes and are absent in the fetal ovary), impose epigenetic breaks on differentiation, inhibit histone-demethylase KDM4B, and then suppression of TAp63 isoforms or up-regulation of anti-apoptotic BCL2 in the OSC sub-lineage would let extra oogonia survive.)
* for very long lived oocytes, consider amphibian or xenopus oocyte DNA DSB or DDR detection and repair genes and mutations
* could we convert spermatogonial sperm cells into mitotically-active oogonial stem cells to produce oocytes instead of sperm? what about the female imprint pattern?
* add Dsup into human oocytes to protect chromatin and protect from DNA damage (see elsewhere on this page for information about Dsup)
* oocyte-specific deletion of Petn to cause premature follicular activation
* disable Hippo to allow for multiple oocyte activation
* look closer at Hippo in the context of ovarian fragmentation techniques
* FSH overexpression to increase fertility
* disable AMH to increase fertility
* <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2861">FOXO3 overexpression for enhanced ovarian reserves</a>
* enable or increase human postnatal oogenesis (a controversial subject in fertility science)
* speculation that [PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) may be related to a larger ovarian follicle pool?](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2655633/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* TODO: consider antibody targets for any of the above, including folliculogenesis, oocyte differentiation, maturation, AMH, follicular atresia, etc.
* TODO: what causes the pre-pubertal drop in follice count or oocyte pool?
* consider GFP expression in oocytes to assist with finding oocytes during future medical procedures
* cortical stroma is largely avascular and has no direct blood supply: arteries penetrate the hilus, branch in the medulla, and then form a fine network that stops at the cortico-medullal border. from there, oxygen, nutrients and drugs must diffuse through the cortical stroma to reach primordial follicles. large animals (sow, cow, ewe) have a thick cortex; the inner third is therefore the most hypoxic and most dependent on follicle-derived VEGF for local neovascularization. cortical stroma itself remains virtually capillary-free until follicles are recruited and secrete angiogenic factors.
* dolphin ovary cortical stroma is very thick. significant hypoxia adaptation. Lactate dehydrogenase isoforms are shifted to the anaerobic LDH-5 form, indicating metabolic reliance on glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation. Antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, catalase, GPx) in dolphin cortical stroma are low and comparable to values measured in cow, and they decline with age, so the same ROS vulnerability exists.
* PCOS may alter stromal vascularity or vascularization.
* programmed or permanent infertility (you'd be making a bet on the development of assisted reproduction technologies in the future, such as creating sperm or eggs from skin cells) (many infertility-causing mutations are known); there are various [[longevity]] benefits from certain kinds of eunuch.

* in mice: [Hdac6 overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5413599/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) causes older mice to continue to produce larger litters.

* PEPCK-Cmus mice (overexpression of cytosolic PEPCK in skeletal muscle) show a longer window of remaining reproductively active

* ventromedial hypothalamus circuits are essential for female mating behavior

* inhibition of hypothalamic AgRP neurons rescues fertility of diet induced obesity female mice ([ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X22010014))

Certain genetic changes could be beneficial for the production of human oocytes that are usable for human cloning, ooplasm donation, somatic cell nuclear transfer, in vitro fertilization, etc: more mitochondria, larger oocytes, more ooplasm, various cell cycle intervention "hooks", ..


### Crazy ideas for more fertility

* fetal ovarian donation either from clones or [fetal ovarian/oocyte donation from an aborted fetus](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/hrge.11.1.127461242080884u)
* [[extra ovaries]], this is genetically difficult to implement.

## Pregnancy

TODO: increase predisposition to twinning or maternal-utero compatibility with pregnancies of multiples. see also fertility upregulation in the TODO section below. see also [[in vitro fertilization]] (WIP).

### Reduced morning sickness during pregnancy

* heightened morning sickness and vomiting: rs1891246, rs790899 -- see <a href="http://www.helpher.org/HER-Research/downloads/2016%20Fejzo%20Genetic%20analysis%20of%20hyperemesis%20gravidarum%20reveals%20association%20with%20intracellular%20calcium%20release%20channel%20RYR2.pdf">Genetic analysis of hyperemesis gravidarum reveals association with intracellular calcium release channel (RYR2)</a>
* "Genetic variants influencing the human chorionic gonadotrophin hormone, serotonin and autoimmune functioning have been proposed as candidates for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP). It has also been proposed that there is a higher frequency of severe NVP in patients with disorders in taste sensation, in the glycoprotein hormone receptor or in fatty acid transport." from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/2/e17/2617151/Cohort-Profile-Nausea-and-vomiting-during">ref</a>

## Puberty and sexual characteristics

* age at first sexual intercourse: mutations near or related to ESR1, CADM2

* number of sexual partners: mutations near or related to CADM2

* risk taking behavior (MDFIC)

* [gay gene](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8558329/)? low p value found via GWAS, but they put it into mice anyway..

### Puberty

rs246185 near MKL2 on chromosome 16p13.12 might be associated with 2.1 weeks earlier menarche, arrests early puberty, also impacts male genital development

puberty block: [global kisspeptin (kiss1) knockout](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0704114104?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [global GPR54 (Kiss1R) knockout](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa035322?utm_source=chatgpt.com), conditional (targeted to ARC or APV neuron) Kiss1 deletion or suppression ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7470906/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), [dicer ablation in Kiss1 neurons](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32347-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

turn off GnRH neurons (or have them dedifferentiate or change identity) via dominant negative FGFR expression? ([ref](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2023.1166132/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com)); or [beta1-integrin ablation in GnRH neurons](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/47/16992?utm_source=chatgpt.com)? targeted ablation of GnRH neurons via cell-type-specific expression of diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) or caspase?

block pituitary response to GnRH via GnRH receptor (GnRHR) knockout

GnRH1 knockout - direct elimination of the primary GnRH peptide.

other possibilities:

* Neurokinin B (NKB/TAC3) knockout: remove the upstream signal for GnRH expression.

* pituitary hormone disruption: eliminate and knockout LH beta subunit (LHB), or FSH beta subunit (FSHB); common glycoprotein alpha subunit (CGA) knockout (to affect both LH and FSH); or pituitary-specific transcription factor knockouts (SF1, PROP1, POU1F1).

* gonadal steroidgenesis blocking (testosterone, estradiol, steroidogenesis regulators, etc..), not entirely recommended.. was the goal eunuch? see separate eunuch section.

* anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) overexpression can suppress gonadal function

* gonadal development: gonadotropin receptor knockouts (LHCGR (LH/hCG receptor), FSHR (FSH receptor))

* germline-specific ablation or apoptosis etc.

* synthetic transcriptional repressors or designer proteins to silence pubertal gene networks

Puberty blockers can also be used to make "perma puppies" that don't go through puberty or mature into adulthood.

TODO: make puberty optional or subject to a master control switch via inducible expression techniques. Let the child trigger puberty whenever they want: wait 5 more years? wait 20 years?

Delay puberty by a substantial amount: look at mutations in/around ZNF483, GPR83 (a G protein‐coupled receptor) related to GnRH neurons (GPR83 seems to modulate signaling of MC3R, which is known to sense nutritional signals). Also LIN28B, MKRN3, KISS1, [rs364663 at the LIN28B locus](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0063821&utm_source=chatgpt.com) (effect ≈ 0.089 years per allele). Delayed puberty has been found in families with mutations in or around FGFR1, GNRHR. [Mutant HS6ST1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00423/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### Menstruation and menstruation pain (dysmenorrhea)

reduce pain in the uterus (dysmenorrhea) via NaV1.7 (SCN9A) congenital pain insensitivity modifications targeted to the uterus? conditional expression based on systemic drug to activate it? It would be interesting to be able to re-activate the SCN9A nociceptors in the uterus during pregnancy.

TRPV1-lineage primary afferents drive pelvic tactile allodynia in endometriosis and VEGF-driven uterine pain models; maybe [TRPV1 antagonism](https://www.jpain.org/issue/S1526-5900%2825%29X0011-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com) or neuron-specific manipulation could blunt uterine pain?

maybe an oxytocin-linked contractility pathway is responsible for some of the pain? ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4548002/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Consider uterus-targeted COX-2 inhibition, knockout, or reduction.

reduce or disable dysmenorrhea (primary locus might be NGF, IL1A, and IL1B). pain severity seems to be associated with nerve growth factor (NGF) mutations ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5436737/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Another way to reduce mensturation pain is to surgical (but could possibly be replicated by genetics): [ovarian denervation for dysmenorrhoea](https://scispace.com/pdf/ovarian-denervation-for-ovarian-dysmenorrhoea-44abtodg3c.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [presacral neurectomy](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1080/00016340600753117?utm_source=chatgpt.com) but high risk of complications including constipation and urinary dysfunction, laproscopic uterine nerve ablation is another option but has not been found to eliminate the pain suggesting that the source of menstrual pain may have multiple origins. Also the laproscopic uterine nerve ablation apparently only offers short-term pain relief (12 months) ([ref](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2508.2000.00393.x?utm_source=chatgpt.com))??

TODO: disable menstruation by switching human biology to estrus instead of menstruation. This will be difficult. Separately, menstruation can be disabled by exogenous systemic oral contraceptives (Lybrel, Seasonique), progestin-only methods (hormonal IUD, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera), etonogestrel implant, and we could express the hormone endogenously if we want to add that. Direct physical endometrial ablation or hysterectomy is an alternative option.

### Menopause

delayed age of menopause: rs13196892 located between genes TXNDC5 and MUTED is associated with delayed age of menopause, and rs6467223 in TNPO3 is also associated with delayed age of menopause.

maybe: optional or delayed menopause, such as through [ovarian time travel](https://gnusha.org/logs/2025-09-08.log) where you cryopreserve one of the ovaries early in life and then implant it 50 years later to use your younger ovary later. This is not a genetic change.

See also puberty blocking genetics.

rs193536 - might impact male genitals and TF binding

The embryonic genital tubercle is the shared primordium of penis/clitoris. Sonic hedgehog SHH from urethral epithelium maintains a proliferative mesenchymal progenitor pool; loss shrinks the organ by ~75% via lengthened cell cycle. WNT5A also drives outgrowth and urethral tubulogenesis. HOXA13/HOXD13 dosage is essential for genital tubercle formation. Androgen signaling (androgen receptor signaling via SRD5A2-mediated DHT) masculinizes the genital tubercle. Androgen receptor loss (Tfm) (such as [AR knockout](https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/30/2/119/2355048?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) yields female-typical external genitalia. In mouse, SRD5A2 loss can be partly buffered by testosterone. Androgen biosynthesis plays some role in addition to androgen receptors.

mouse - [Delineating a conserved genetic casette promoting outgrowth of body appendages](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003231). Note that the genital tubercle is larger in the AER-R26Fgf8-GOF (gain of function) embryos which also show excessive limb development. There is also in one figure a postaxial extra digit in the forelimb. "To compare the function of FGF8 in the limb and GT, we mated the R26Fgf8 allele with a transgenic Msx2-Cre line [35], which confers Cre expression in the forming and mature AER and the ventral limb ectoderm. As expected, the AER-R26Fgf8-GOF mutants exhibited excessive limb growth and developed extra digits (asterisk in Figure 3J), an enlarged calcaneus bone (arrowhead in Figure 3K), and ectopic skeletal elements (arrows in Figure 3J–3K, and Figure S4G) in both forelimbs and hindlimbs. These overgrowth phenotypes are similar but more severe than what has been observed in the [AER-Fgf4-GOF embryos](https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/133/1/33/43192/Increasing-Fgf4-expression-in-the-mouse-limb-bud), and further support the concept that FGF8 plays a pivotal role in promoting the outgrowth of both appendages."

# Muscle

## Muscle hypertrophy

Muscle hypertrophy can be achieved through myostatin inhibition or knockout of myostatin.

There are a number of options here, but with germline modification, a muscle-specific knockout of ACVR2B or myostatin are good choices.

Also follistatin overexpression in muscle.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myostatin-related_muscle_hypertrophy">myostatin</a> and follistatin and muscle hypertrophy, downregulation of activin type II receptor (ActRIIA/B) (targeted by bimagrumab).

## Muscle hyperplasia

As an alternative to muscle hypertrophy, you could instead increase muscle cell progenitors and increase the number of myocytes in the limbs or certain muscle groups (muscular hyperplasia).

TEAD1 (Hippo pathway effector complex partner): [myofiber-specific TEAD1 overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5059137/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) drives a dramatic satellite-cell hyperplasia (many more Pax7+ cells) without increasing muscle size at baseline. This primes tissue for larger regenerative output because there are more myoblasts available to form new fibers.

Fn14 Tnfrsf12a (TWEAK receptor) in satellite cells increases satellite cell proliferation/self-renewal during injury.

[beta-catenin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3479319/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) activity is critical for determining myofiber number during myogenesis in embryogenesis.

Tcf4+ fibroblasts / PDGFRα+ FAPs regulate myogenesis and can bias fiber formation during development and regeneration. ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3005608/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

[A missense mutant myostatin causes hyperplasia without hypertrophy in the mouse muscle](http://www.genome.tokushima-u.ac.jp/dgi/JAPDGI/images/publicarion%20PDF/2002/Biochem%20Biophys%20Res%20Commun2%202002.pdf) (2002) (myostatin C313Y)

Note: in both muscular hypertrophy and muscular hyperplasia, it is important to check what happens to the heart, or to specifically exclude the heart from targeting.

## Muscle strength

[muscle-targeted IGF1 overexpression](https://skeletalmusclejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2044-5040-1-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (various promoters: mIGF-1, α-actin, MCK) increases postnatal muscle mass and strength; multiple lines report larger fibers and higher tetanic force, and protection from age-related weakness. Mechanistically linked to AKT/mTOR.

FOXO family (muscle catabolism gatekeepers): [FoxO1/3/4 triple knockout](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9891940/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) mice maintain or increase strength into aging by suppressing atrophy programs (UPS/autophagy genes). Earlier work shows FoxO loss protects from muscle loss.

[inducible/conditional muscle AKT1 activation causes fiber hypertrophy and higher strength](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131%2807%2900338-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com), especially in fast glycolytic fibers. myr-AKT1 models show increased grip/peak force and IIb fiber growth.

enhancing ACTN3 (α-actinin-3 "power gene") function or maintaining fast-fiber identity is pro-strength.

[conditional Ctnnb1 (beta-catenin)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2675868/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) studies show it's critical for fetal myogenic progenitor number and eventual myofiber output, which will secondarily set attainable strength.

## Muscle (hyper)innervation

Note that muscles naturally pull in more innervation on its own when growing, although only to a point. [Myostatin null mice show more total axons](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22499097/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and more motor axon innervation. By comparison, [muscle IGF1 increases muscle mass but not innervation](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/20/9/1844/883396?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

* [hyperinnervation via muscle GDNF overexpression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9497292/) but no behavior changes reported.
* [LRP4 overexpression in muscle](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8369839/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) improves neuromuscular junction (NMJ) structure/innervation. increased grip strength, hanging time, and running distance.

Early in development, [each endplate is initially polyneuronal but undergoes synapse elimination](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7144835/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to end up mono-innervated. Is this necessary? Can it be eliminated?

## Muscle metabolism

PEPCK-C overexpression: In muscle, this allows greatly improved metabolism and endurance (see "mighty mice"). Synergistic effect with myostatin inhibition is untested.

## Sprinting vs endurance

* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTN3">alpha-actin-3</a> (actinin) for endurance and increased power in sprinters (<a href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(21)00013-6">Loss of α-actinin-3 during human evolution provides superior cold resilience and muscle heat generation</a>) ("The results showed that the skeletal muscle of people lacking α-aktinin-3 had a greater proportion of slow-twitch fibers. When they were in the process of cooling, these people were able to maintain their body temperature in a more energy-efficient way. People who lack α-aktinin-3 rarely succeed in sports requiring strength and explosiveness, while a tendency towards greater capacity has been observed in these people in endurance sports.")

# Theoretical "heterozygote advantages" genes

The principle here is that diseases such as sickle cell or Tay-Sachs, among many others, persist in a population because having one 'good' and one 'bad' copy of the gene offers a significant advantage - in disease resistance, intelligence, etc.

While it would be nice to find a point mutation that would mimic the benefits of heterozygosity, the most straightforward option would be to give someone both variants of the gene, with ~50% expression of each.

[Efficient introduction of specific homozygous and heterozygous mutations using CRISPR/Cas9](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17664) -- there is at least one other technique for doing this, perhaps the other one wasn't co-authored by the ex-president of stanford (an independent panel found "manipulation and/or grossly inadequate data handling"? in other research).

Using heterozygous alleles is useful because we know several exact effects of +/- gene dosage, whereas it would take possibly substantial trial-and-error to figure out the exact expression profile to replicate via synthetic gene circuit for expression of that same gene. It's not necessarily "50% expression" merely because the effect is caused by heterozygosity..

It could be possible to program germline genomic programs that cause heterozygotic allele dosage depending on cell type or [[cell-specific expression]] throughout development or post-birth gene expression, instead of whole-body heterozygotic allele. So some cells or tissues or organs in the body can be homozygous for the allele while other cells can have different gene dosage and therefore different expression. In general it is probably better to have whole-body heterozyous programming for an allele because you can do upfront sequencing and quality control on the genome before making a fetus, whereas chromosome editing during development (or later in life) will have more moving parts that need to be more carefully quality controlled upfront.

While this document is mainly about germline genetic engineering for whole-body genetic modification, it would also be interesting to consider any beneficial impact from heterozygotic allele gene editing in different cell populations in the adult via adult gene therapy or cell therapy.

TODO: vitamin D linked heterozygotic advantage mutation that allows for escape from accelerated clearance. Causes lower risk of severe respiratory infections and better pregnancy outcomes at high latitude. GC1F/GC1S.

# George Church's human genetic engineering wish list

[George Church's human genetic engineering wish list](https://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/protect.html)


Multigenic traits can have single gene variants -- often rare in populations, (or synthetic alleles absent in nature) with large impacts. Synthetic gene circuits can also provide a monogenic effect.

>Genotype: -/- means double-null for the gene (from both mother and father).  +/- means one copy ok (+)  and one broken (-) is sufficient to have a positive impact.  The rest require very specific sequences to see the positive effect. For example E6V means that at position 6 an "E" (Glutamate amino acid codon GAG) is mutated into a "V" (Valine codon GTG).

### geochurch space genetics

**Space genetics**: What if we cure aging and eliminate poverty and diseases of developing nations? We're going to have overpopulation, or at least some people say that. I don't think it's a great solution to say well we're not going to cure diseases of poverty or aging of the industrialized nation. One possibility is <a href="http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/spacex/elon-musk-making-humans-a-multiplanetary-species/">going to space</a>. I don't mean this frivolously. It's a good idea for our species because we're at risk from supervolcanoes and asteroids. In space, we have a new set of problems including radiation and low gravity even on Mars. And then there's space genetics issues. We have a consortium on this and space colony challenges.

We have challenges like gravity, osteoporosis, neuro-behavioral issues, microbiome issues.

Kind of a quirky list here. These are rare protective alleles. They are things that make your bones extra strong which could result in something that could help in space, or on earth. Some that reduce pain sensitivity, which you might want to turn on and off, because if you have it off all the time then maybe you end up hurting yourself like kids chewing on their tongues. ABCC11 will give you low odor which might be helpful in space travel contexts. The good version is common in Asian populations.

There are some things that have been tested in animals, like low cancer and high cognitive ability.

What about radiation resistance? Here's a case in the literature where radiation resistance was improved 100,000-fold. 10-fold using e14-deletion. 50-fold using recA. 20-fold using yfjK. And 10-fold using dnaB. See Ecoli, Byrne et al, eLife 2014 ("<a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/3/e01322">Evolution of extreme resistance to ionizing radiation via genetic adaptation of DNA repair</a>"). This only requires 4 mutations. There is a wide variation in natural organisms, but the only difference here is those 4 mutations.

[Dsup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dsup) from tardigrades for radiation resistance. Mentioned elsewhere on this page in the DNA damage resistance section as well as the longevity section.

<a name="regeneration" />
# Regeneration

Make a general embryological platform for regeneration. Salamanders achieve this through dedifferentiation but perhaps for human we can achieve this via in vivo maintenance of primordial pluripotent stem cells throughout adult life. There might be other ways to achieve this goal around healing.

[Transient inactivation of Rb and ARF yields regenerative cells from postmitotic mammalian muscle](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2919350/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

[Lack of p21 expression links cell cycle control and appendage regeneration in mice](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1000830107?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

TODO: maintain primordial pluripotent stem cell pools throughout adult life.

TODO: look at salamander cell dedifferentiation capabilities, can we import that into human cells as a switchable capability?

Just saying "regeneration" is kind of ridiculous, it's like saying "let's add hiberation" -- okay good luck...

# TODO

* Tetracycline response elements, i.e. tet-on and tet-off, can be used for transgenes where constant expression is undesirable. While a number of options for such inducible expression exist, the tet system is the most studied. It is left as an exercise to the reader to determine which genes would be suitable candidates [I will add some when I get around to it (editor's note: 13 years later.... Also DREADDs might allow for higher multiplexing or bandwidth?)].

* l-gulonolactone oxidase knock-in (re-enable human synthesis of vitamin C) <http://www.anti-agingfirewalls.com/2018/03/11/double-gene-knockout-behind-obesity-epidemic/>, or via GULO

* retinoid conversion: [BCMO1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19103647)

* <a href="http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/hgp-write/2016-05-10/synthesizing-a-prototrophic-human-genome/">Engineering into human genome the capability to synthesize essential amino acids, essential fatty acids and essential vitamins</a> ("synthesizing a prototrophic human genome")

* refactor critical enzymes that use bizarre minerals or other uncommon elements to use more normal biology, by rational protein engineering and directed evolution to find highly active alternatives, while also possibly fixing any cross-dependency or mineral regulation strategies that were previously in place to regulate the unction of those enzymes using those minerals. This in effect will reduce dependency on multivitamins or other vitamin elements.

* for digestion, consider: add desaturase enzyme to convert from n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to n-3 PUFA (like DHA or other omega 3 fatty acid) ([fat-1 pigs](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5940165/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [fat-1 cattle](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3267699/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), pigs with both fat1 and fat2 to handle more precursors, ...); keratinase, chitinase, uricase, better lysozymes, oxalate oxidase, ligninase, better proteases. Not all of these should be encoded into human germline due to inefficiency. Also, adding this to our food supply or gut microbiome is easier than adding it to human germline. Are there other digestion and metabolism modifications we should consider?

* optimize metabolism and nutrition for modern dietary demands (see [[here|nutrition]])

* human metabolism and weight loss and insulin stuff and kidney stuff, see <http://gnusha.org/logs/2018-02-18.log>

* hemoglobin from horses? can we just slap in a better myoglobin?

* add sickle cell hemoglobin for anti-malaria reasons

* for metabolism, consider ATP synthase re-engineering to remove more c-rings, or add more c-rings; differential expression of this ATP synthase based on which cell or tissue.

* reduce oxidative stress: enhance antioxidant defense, reduce ROS production, improve ROS detoxification, support redox homeostasis. Consider increasing expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidases, catalase (target to peroxisomes or mitochondria), mitochondrial peroxiredoxins; for redox regulators: NRF2/NFE2L2 gain of function, FOXO3 overexpression to upregulate MnSOD/catalase/sestrin, PGC-1α to induce mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant enzymes (SOD2, GPX1); ROS producers - knockdown NADPH oxidases as a major source of ROS in many tissues, monoamine oxidase B, SDHA complex II, .... increase GCLC/GCLM to ratelimit glutathione synthesis; SLC7A11 overexpression to support GSH synthesis; thoredoxin reductase overexpression to regenerate reduced thioredoxin which is a key redox buffer. Careful about where these changes are expressed, in what cells or which tissues. This might be slop, consider systemic effects and oxidative homeostasis/respiration/etc.

* <a href="http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/hgp-write/2016-05-10/ultra-safe-cell-line/">multi-virus resistance</a> through recoding the genome to use an alternate codon mapping code so that virus genomes that use natty codon-AA mappings are unable to replicate inside cells that have their whole genome codon recoded. (belongs in immune section?)

* TODO: review <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_accelerated_regions">human accelerated regions</a> (segments of the human genome that are conserved throughout vertebrate evolution but are strikingly different in humans, especially compared to chimpanzees); and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). See also "<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10530">A high-resolution map of human evolutionary constraint using 29 mammals</a>. Note also that thee are human-specific deletions compared to chimpanzees in otherwise conserved sequences. "A study examining intragenic clustering of human accelerated elements found that the transcription factor neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3 (NPAS3) has the largest population of noncoding-accelerated regions. NPAS3 is active during mammalian brain development and the human accelerated elements within this locus predominantly appear to act as transcriptional enhancers."

* find areas of "accelerated evolution" in recent human genome; look at common mutations in the population; most mutations are probably detrimental or neutral. It's possible to figure out which genes (and alleles in particular) have been spreading rapidly throughout the population, so we should look at that information. Compare against neanderthal genome and other ancient human genomes that have been sequenced. Compare also to great ape genomes, chimpanzee, orangutan, macquee, etc. See also [recent human adaptation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11419161/) (2024).

* "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4626285/">Partitioning heritability by functional annotation using genome-wide association summary statistics</a> table 1 shows regions correlated with different conditions such as height (chondrogenic dif, H3K27ac), age at menarche (fetal brain tissue, H3K4me3), etc. Modifications in H3K4me3 in the angular gyrus correlate with years of education.

* in human vs apes, humans have 5 more copies of DRD5 than any other primate <a href="https://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/drd5-dopamine-receptor-d5">ref</a>; and an increase in variable number of tandem repeats within the coding region of the third exon of the DRD4 gene (different gene).

* stomach size minimization or control

* organ duplication: multiple kidneys, multiple livers, multiple hearts (Doctor Who syndrome), functional polydactyly

* kidney/liver size increase, or <a href="http://gnusha.org/logs/2017-04-30.log">supernumerary kidneys (extra kidneys)</a>, possibly through genetic modification but also possibly through cloning and etal surgery to add cloned liver (as an alternative to liver organoid transplant or liver organ donor transplant)

* [[sleep]]: reduced or zero perception of sleep pressure, anti-tiredness (might be a form of insomnia? might be adenosine metabolism related in brain neurons?) Stronger chemical or molecular control over sleep-related neurons.

* copy-paste some of the gene therapies from earonesty's list: <https://web.archive.org/web/20150907230432/http://www.documentroot.com/2014/08/gene-therapies-i-want-to-see-developed.html>

* gallstone disease - variants in ABCG8 and TRAF3 <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/20/265728">ref</a>

* diving; large spleen - PDE10A mutations, thyroid hormone modulation; BDKRB2 - affects constriction of blood vessels in the extremities; FAM178B - related to carbon dioxide blood levels.

* alcohol stuff: ADH1B2 and ADH1B3 contribute to faster conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde. ALDH1B1 contributes to faster clearance of acetaldehyde. ALDH22 common in asians is the alcohol flush reaction and is unable to break down acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol, so it's much easier to get alcohol poisoning.

* tay-sachs allele and IQ ? was this debunked or no?

* personality - see <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/11/26/476010.full.pdf">ref</a> (?) This system is conserved across various mammalian species. SNORD copy number variations. "Particularly significant are SNORD115 and SNORD116\_2. The latter is the variant that is predicted to bind to Ankrd11 exon X, while the possible target genes for the other two SNORD116 variants are not yet clear. These latter ones show generally only little copy number variation (Table 1). However, we note that the direction of the correlation is different between rodents and humans. In humans, the relatively higher anxiety group has the smaller number of copies, while it is the other way around in the three tested rodent species (see above)." -- regulation of behavioral variance using snoRNAs.

* [disable human wisdom teeth](https://twitter.com/bramcohen/status/1135584368611610624) aka third molar agenesis or M3 agenesis

  * [PAX9 Ala240Pro Is Not Associated with Hypodondotia/Oligodontia or Cleft Lip/Palate but May Cause Congenitally Missing Third Molars.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1458632/)

    * other mutations in PAX9, and mutations in MSX1, AXIN2, ectodysplasin EDA/EDAR cause oligodontia?

  * [GWAS third molar agenesis](https://www.nature.com/articles/jhg2013106) THSD7B, GRIN2B, LUZP2, ZBTB24, THYN1 are all probably bad targets

* <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Embryo-editing">gwern.net/Embryo-editing</a>

* encode CRISPR-Cas9 or even dCas9 fusion proteins into the germline genome such that future payloads can rely on Cas9 or dCas9 availability for future genetic upgrade delivery into adults.

* disable germline transmission of certain modifications (germline editing is primarily required for zero mosaicism by modifying pre-conception or post-conception a single cell embryo, but this is only a delivery detail not something specifically related to desiring inheritance; long-term inheritance is a secondary goal that could be toggled on and off)

* if you can cause ancephalic (or anencephalic?) human fetal development via embryo engineering (such as for human cloning), then i wonder if you could introduce an engineered non-ancephalic neural cell line into the embryo (hybrid, mosaic or chimeric embryo) and have it develop the cortical neural tissues instead of the ancephalic cell line. this reduces concerns of non-brain pleitropy. The metabolic and other biological requirements in neurons is likely to be vastly different from the demands of the other cell types in the body; an increase in separation of concerns can reduce undesirable or unintended side effects including non-genomic other-tissue/other-organ "off-target effects".

* anti-sunburn, sunburn protection- see SOD pathway upregulation. additional radiation damage resistance, radiation damage repair, DNA damage repair pathway upregulate, ...

* reduce human skin attractiveness to mosquitos, possibly related to carboxylic acid secretions. Why can't we secrete nicer smelling odors or perfumes anyway.

* TODO: incorporate things about neochromosomes and human artificial chromosomes (HACs) from the IRC logs. sc2.0 had a neochromosome to store all their tRNA synthetases. you can knock out an essential gene on a natural chromosome and put it on the artificial one so the neochromosome doesn't get lost over time.

* TODO: make a generic embryological platform for [[cell-specific expression]] and cell life cycle control during embryological development to target specific progenitor cell types or proliferators to increase their abundance, or otherwise regulate their proliferation or upregulate/downregulate, such that we can modularly plugin or swap out which cells we are targeting, based on cell lifecycle, rather than having to focus on unique genes related to those specific tissues or organs. Or will we have to edit specific to each tissue type due to quorum sensing and other growth limiting factors? <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674(00)81237-4">Loss of CDK inhibitor p27Kip1</a> globally increases organ size and causes multiorgan hyperplasia. Consider CDK4/Cyclin-D1 overexpression. Generic proliferation effectors shown to scale progenitor pools during development.

* improved gyrification, sulcri, encephalization things, better brain anatomy, better white fiber tracts

* appearance, face genetics, symmetry, which parent does the child look like, etc

* resistance to cryoprotectant toxicity for cryonics, cryovitrification, glutaraldehyde cross-linking, etc.

* TODO: make a document or system for GWAS variants, or alleles, or other mutations, indels, chromosomal microdeletions, etc, for which variants to avoid when making a germline genetically engineered human. Simply eliminating non-consensus genome mutations will substantially improve health and longevity, as Bram Cohen likes to point out. Did he not publish on this? there's no reference for this concept? There is also some additional value in intentionally avoiding known-harmful mutations or alterations.

* acromegaly-like targeted GH/IGF1 receptor improvement in hands to increase hand size?

* supernumerary or extra cranial nerve roots or other spinal nerve fibers, with the expectation that they might be repurposed in the future for brain-computer interfaces or for reinnervation of muscles. Could be convenient to have some spare nerve fibers around that are already correctly wired into the brain. Might also help with surgical repair of brachial plexus injuries or other nerve fiber dissection injuries. With spare nerve fibers, the surgeon would have sufficient material to patch you back together. Are there any nerve fiber targeted genetic changes that could assist with PEG+chitin nerve fiber repair and healing?

* codon recoding: other than for multi-virus anti-virus resistance, check for poorly coded proteins in the human genome and recode for codon efficiency. Should we migrate proteins that use "rare codons" to use less rare codons (figure out how to achieve equivalent function with a non-rare codon)?

* whole body cell [[lineage tracing]] could be scientifically interesting, except that other than for [[brain uploading]] not sure if it has a practical use?

* TODO: figure out how to add electroreceptors to human biology. See <https://gnusha.org/logs/2025-10-01.log> for some ideas about converting primary sensory neurons in epidermis for the detection of microvolt electric field potentials on contact with (for example) someone else's head as a sort of EEG electrode and sensing strategy. With an adequate antennae or microvoltage sensor in the cortex, it may also be possible to do remote (steerable? steered?) sensing of distant entrainment without a direct axon inside of the brain.

* TODO: magnetoreception from birds? This should already be somewhere on this page. Don't know if it would work or if it has been added to mice yet.

* think hard about other outcomes that could be achieved with "immediate early genes" neural behavior cell-tagging techniques.

* TODO: pick good cell expansion, neuronal morphology modifications, electrophysiology tweaks, or optogenetic targets in the prefrontal cortex. These are classic sites for abstraction, rule representation, reasoning, and cognitive control. In primates, the caudate, nucleus accumbens, and dorsal striatum are heavily implicated in controlling rule switching and updating. More generally there are many other circuits in the brain worthy of consideration for either (1) germline cell growth control, (2) overexpression or other regulation of protein expression, and (3) encoding of optogenetic receptors, such as in regions such as thalamocortical, perceptual, direct somatosensory neuron activation, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, etc. Is it possible to pick certain neurons for optogenetic activation and use an out-of-band computer algorithm for the enhancement of learning rates, reasoning, abstraction, or other tasks? Does adding cells help? Does adding NMDA receptors help? more/less NMDA receptors? NR2B receptors? Direct control over cell-targeted synaptic plasticity under computer control via biofeedback and optogenetics? Consider targeting of association cortex or temporal cortex. What about online real-time stimulation changes for language/grammar learning?

* from <https://gnusha.org/logs/2025-11-17.log> -- "What about changing the human genome so that no single point mutation is able to significantly disrupt any particular vital protein residue function? In other words, re-encode all proteins etc so that important residues have redundant specification or function. We can also systematically test for mutations at any given point to ensure sufficient redundancy. For starters we can base that on which genetic diseases we see where only a small mutation is fatal even on one of the two alleles. Fatal mutations are often filtered out earlier in life like before week 10 of pregnancy, so they are harder to know about. Or even just extra backup copies of especially fragile genes or proteins at risk from single mutations."

* TODO: incorporate various weird ideas from <https://gnusha.org/logs/2025-11-18.log> like: 1) "Instead of presenting literal random peptides via MHC, cells present a compressed description of their internal state. T-cells would then fuzzy match these protein barcodes for an overall cell state degradation score to decision the cell. It’s like giving the immune system a diagnostic checksum for each cell's gene expression or metabolic state or other internal state." 2) "cryptography for secure cell-cell communication". and: "Application: Prevent metastatic mimicry. Cancer cells cannot replicate the precise signaling cryptographic key of authentic tissue. ... right, I guess you would want to send the whole genome or transcriptional state of the cell with each message so that your neighbor cells can verify your messages?" 4) "for intracellular barcode based memory systems, you could do intravenous delivery of small molecule timestamp peptides or oligonucleotides with a known sequence, have them get incorporated into growing barcode memory systems, and then you have a systemic timestamp or clock mechanism... kinda."

### Neuronal enhancements for brain-computer interface

TODO: larger neurons on surface of brain for interface with brain-computer interfaces? are there any other genetic changes to facilitate interfacing with long-term electrode implants? or the vascular electrode (stentrode?) scheme? optogenetic control of neurons proximal to the surface of the neocortex or other brain cortex surfaces? what about inside grooves, gyri or sulcri? Optogenetics seems like one area to consider for brain-computer interfacing at least in the "write" direction. There are many [[optogenetics]] systems available for germline and in vivo stimulaton of freely moving/behaving animals with implants. Minimize astrocyte reactivity via reduction of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression for long term electrode compatibility. Coat brain implant electrodes with AAV for localized delivery and expression of anti-inflammatory factors, modulation of inflammatory response or pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduce microglial activation around implants. Integrin overexpression to enhance cell adhesion to electrode surfaces. ECM modifiers like fibronectin expression. Red-shifted opsins like ChrimsonR or Jaws for deeper tissue penetration in optogenetics, or two-photon responsive opsins. Are there any free-range animal BCI research projects using genetically encoded voltage indicators to transmit information to the BCI? Or fluorescent calcium indicators? or is it only via chronic window imaging? Ion channel overexpression and other electrophysiology shaping. Would larger dendiritc arbors be helpful? For stentrodes or vascular interface is there anything available to improve interfacing? Upconversion nanoparticles for even more distant neural stimulation via optogenetics. For long-term chronic implants consider LOX (lysyl oxidase) knockdown to reduce collagen crosslinking. BCI could deliver AAV with gene therapy for anti-apoptotic factors, neurotrophic support.  Sonogenetic interfacial improvement via mechanosensitive ion channels. Check out magnetogenetics to see if magnetic field responsive ion channels are working or not (maybe something from birds). Neurons can report on their own activity via activity-dependent fluorophores or the oscillatory waves system.

### Multiplex DREADDs for cell-type-specific retargeting of transient optogenetic receptor expression

With 46 unique DREADDs with zero cross-talk, you can systemically target every different cell type in the human body. With 92 bits you could get unique cell addressability (uh depending on diffusion and stuff), which seems less useful because you won't know which exact cell got which address? This scheme uses combinatorial ligand-AND addressing: each cell type is prewired with a unique subset of orthogonal DREADDs, and it is "armed" only when the correct delivery of ligands (a k-of-n code) is present over a sliding window period, triggering a synthetic transcriptional circuit that transiently expresses an optogenetic receptor equipped with self-limiting kinetics (e.g., degrons) so the receptor eventually gets recycled while transcriptional activity also decays with time. The opto-receptor can be tuned to cell-type-specific behavior for neurons or other cell types for GPCR style circuit triggering. The optogenetic element can be a receptor or it can be an azobenzene-controlled transcription factor inside the cell nucleus. GPCR per cell type can be hooked up to specific cell-type-specific genetic programming instead of universally expressing a single optogenetic receptor type. Further complicating matters there are also "optogenetic GPCRs" in the literature. Sonoporation mechanosensitive receptor types are available. Various chemogenetic receptors are available. Lots of options here.

Anyway, the result of this scheme is that you can reuse optogenetic receptor wavelengths over the lifetime of the human and use the same wavelengths (at different times) to trigger different kinds of neurons at different times (or other cell behaviors that were pre-engineered). You might also be able to scale via different optogenetic wavelength receptors for simultaneous stimulation or activation of different neuron types through this scheme.

For optogenetic receptors I think we only have a handful right now, maybe four or five? Double check.

And unfortunately the current record for DREADD multiplexing seems to be three or four ligands/receptors?? That's not very multiplexicative so far...

This technique could be combined with "immediate early genes" to specifically "tag" neurons for later re-activation. Maybe even in a "reusable" or "refreshable" way so that "immediate early gene" techniques can be used multiple times throughout the animal's life to target different neurons or different neural circuits.

This could also be used to facilitate better brain-computer interfaces, especially stimulation. Read-out could also be enhanced via fluorescence, optical oscillatory wave generation, luciferase, or other cell signal generation.

See also: <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(22)00128-4">Ligand-receptor promiscuity enables cellular addressing</a>.

See also <https://gnusha.org/logs/2025-10-02.log> which is where the multiplex DREADD technique for optogenetic re-binding scheme was originally conceived or speculated.

TODO: Also think more about what could be done if we instead use 92 bits to uniquely address every cell in the body. The problem is that you don't know which cells correspond to which addresses. You might be able to localize it by randomly triggering different bits and then looking for some sort of fluorescent event throughout the body to identify the mapping between different bit-vectors and different cells. On second thought, you will need more than 92 bits because you cannot enforce that every cell has a unique address except by making it statistically improbable through the provision of more bits. How many more would you need?

And how would you learn which cells respond to which combinations of bits? How would you solve the search problem where you need to figure out the mapping between a bit-vector and a specific cell? You would want a way to query all the cells in the body and ask them to please fluoresce if they respond to bit n in the bit-vector and then you record that information. You sweep through all the bits and then you combine into a giant bitmask table to get the address of each cell that you were visually tracking.

possibly the cells could self-report via protein recording device that they make internally and export, or it's on a cilia on the external surface of the cell membrane and then detaches and is recoverable in the bloodstream. You could use connectome-seq style [[mapseq]] techniques to get a rough approximation of their location in the global graph of cell-cell adjoinancy matrix if not their exact location at least. You could then cartographically pinpoint some of the more popular or easily-identifiable nodes in the graph to track them to their exact location in the mammalian body, and use that to approximate the physical targeting of nearby adjacent cells.

### More DNA damage repair via DNA error correction codes etc

TODO: DNA damage repair: improve mismatch repair; improve homologous recombination; upregulate DNA repair enzymes; improve DNA damage radiation resistance; re-engineer the whole human genome and central dogma of molecular biology to use checksums and error correction codes so that DNA mutation errors can be correctly fixed. There are many kinds of error correction codes with interesting properties, such as being able to fix a certain number of errors but at a certain cost of redundancy or encoding size. This would require substantial theoretical molecular biology and protein engineering, and it would likely have a substantial energy cost.

Even more advanced would be a cell network consensus-based DNA error detection and DNA error correction system. This consensus-based DNA validation system would use engineered intercellular communication networks where individual cells randomly sample genomic fragments and query neighboring cells through engineered quorum sensing molecules, DNA fragment querying to neighboring cells, large natural competence pores (or other kinds of transmembrane pores), exosomes, and synthetic G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways to establish distributed consensus about sequence fidelity. The approach exploits the statistical improbability that identical mutations occur independently across multiple adjacent cells, using Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms implemented through genetic circuits to distinguish between inherited damage (present across lineages) and spontaneous mutations (isolated to individual cells), ultimately triggering targeted DNA repair mechanisms via fragment import, controlled apoptosis, or lineage replacement when consensus indicates genomic corruption has occurred.

To some extent, the immune system already performs rudimentary versions of this through MHC presentation surveillance and the elimination of cells displaying aberrant peptide signatures, but this proposed system would extend beyond protein-level monitoring to direct nucleotide sequence validation, creating a tissue-wide distributed computing network for genomic integrity maintenance that could dramatically reduce cancer incidence and age-related genetic drift across multicellular organisms. Is there a way to present mRNA transcripts via a MHC-like strategy so that the immune system can monitor random genomic fragments? MHC presentation would be expanded to include objects beyond proteins.

Stretching even farther into the realm of fantasy, another alternative is to design a mechanism of delivering and replacing chromosomes to cells throughout the body via a very large natural competence pore or some sort of exosome technique. Instead of relying on the cellular machinery to maintain the genome over decades or centuries, instead here the idea is to directly deliver genomic material through the bloodstream to distribute to cells throughout the body and re-program them with a known-good copy of the original genome. This would apply also to mtDNA, or maybe all the mitochondrial DNA gets internalized into the nuclear genome anyway for other reasons. Synthetic horizontal gene transfer is another option: cells could communicate with each other and decide which cell has the superior genomic integrity, and then copies are sent over to the other cells (probably easier to just have the other cells die and use cellular division to replace them instead).

Other simple interventions may be appropriate, such as a radiation counter or something that detects a higher incidence of mutational damage, and does consensus or quorum sensing based off of localized high mutational damage or load to decide for apoptosis or whether some other ongoing incident is occurring. A single incident of a DNA base flipping is one thing, but multiple mutations occurring in short succession should be treated as another issue entirely.

ref: [Enzymatic elimination of errors from DNA using error correction codes](https://groups.google.com/g/enzymaticsynthesis/c/WvDidIldm7c/m/o7LYEwYgAgAJ) which also mentions an idea for "ECDSA encryption enzymes" (yeah good luck with that buddy).

### dental caries vaccine

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caries_vaccine)

a genetically modified strain of Streptococcus mutans called BCS3-L1, is incapable of producing lactic acid, which dissolves tooth enamel, and aggressively replaces native flora. In laboratory tests, rats who were given BCS3-L1 were conferred with a lifetime of protection against S. mutans.
Dr. Jeffrey D. Hillman suggests that treatment with BCS3-L1 in humans could also provide a lifetime of protection, or, at worst, require occasional re-applications. He figures the treatment would be available in dentists' offices and "will probably cost less than $100.
