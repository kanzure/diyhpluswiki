# Human germline genetic engineering, modifications and enhancements

This is a collection of human germline genetic modifications that has been collected over a period of more than 10 years now. It's the largest collection on the internet, and we welcome most contributions. Check the [[hplusroadmap|discord]] if you want.

Please note that many of these candidate mutations need to be re-checked, double checked, and further studied. Be aware that sometimes the statistical power is somewhat lacking, study designs are sometimes bad, and such. Other times, there are very well known mutations that will definitely work. There's no magic short cut other than doing the work and figuring it out. Another theoretical issue is with regards to multiple simultaneous changes and whether effects can be preserved when making simultaneous changes.

## Gene candidates for human germline genetic modification

### Radiation resistance

CD47 suppression provides gobs of radiation resistance. prevent binding of thrombospondin to CD47 with a drug, inhibits NO production and somehow this prevents radiation damage and kills cancer cells. antisense CD47 RNA should do the trick permanently.

((Add better summary here))

* <http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/01/can-high-tech-medicine-render-radiation-harmless.html>

* <http://www.dotmed.com/news/story/10571>

* <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD47#Angiogenesis>

Other radiation resistance: "What about radiation resistance? Here's a case in the literature where radiation resistance was improved 100,000-fold. 10-fold using e14-deletion. 50-fold using recA. 20-fold using yfjK. And 10-fold using dnaB. See Ecoli, Byrne et al, eLife 2014 ("<a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/3/e01322">Evolution of extreme resistance to ionizing radiation via genetic adaptation of DNA repair</a>"). This only requires 4 mutations. There is a wide variation in natural organisms, but the only difference here is those 4 mutations."

### P53 overexpression

As the "guardian of the genome", p53 is missing in many cancers, and has been investigated as a gene therapy option for cancer. Introducing a separate copy, or copies of the gene from the wild-type could reduce the incidence of knockout mutations that normally lead to cancer.

p53 is highly relevant in [[longevity]], see the longevity section later on this page.

Other anti-cancer pathways should be up-regulated and enhanced.

### Lower cardiovascular disease and lower coronary disease

milano allele: "Apolipoprotein A-1 Milano (also ETC-216, now MDCO-216) (ApoA-1 milano) is a naturally occurring mutated variant of the apolipoprotein A1 protein found in human HDL, the lipoprotein particle that carries cholesterol from tissues to the liver and is associated with protection against cardiovascular disease. ApoA1 Milano was first identified by Dr. Cesare Sirtori in Milan, who also demonstrated that its presence significantly reduced cardiovascular disease, even though it caused a reduction in HDL levels and an increase in triglyceride levels."

<a name="PCSK5" />
Those with the PCSK5 gene have 88 percent lower coronary disease.

Also, [PCSK9 loss-of-function](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7447476/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (according to George Church) is also capable of lowering susceptibility to coronary disease and causes lifelong low LDL-C.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ApoA-1_Milano>

### Protective mutations for heart attacks

* PCSK9 - 80% lower risk
* NPCILI - 53% lower risk
* LPA - 24% lower risk
* APOC3 - 40% lower risk
* ANGPTL3 - 34% lower risk
* ANGPTL4 - 53% lower risk
* ASGR1 - 34% lower risk

#### Anti-diabetes

dominant HLA class II protection: [HLA-DQB1\*06:02](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32439825/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), typically carried on the DRB115:01-DQA101:02-DQB1\*06:02 (DR15-DQ6) haplotype, confers dominant protection across the pre-symptomatic stages and against clinical type 1 diabetes. It's present in less than 1% of people who develop type 1 diabetes.

[TLR1 I602S (hypofunction)](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1000979&utm_source=chatgpt.com) provides protection from mycobacterial disease (TB/leprosy).

#### Autoimmune disease protection

[TYK2 P1104A (rs34536443)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11885862/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) shows broad protection across many autoimmune diseases. Hypomorphic TYK2 allele lowers risk for multiple disorders (T1D, MS, RA, IBD, thyroid autoimmunity, psoriasis); homozygosity can increase tuberculosis risk. See also [ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6355696/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

#### Wild ideas for upgrading the immune system

* [Donor MHC-specific thymus vaccination allows for immunocompatible allotransplantation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-024-01049-5) perhaps possible to encode this into the genome instead. For example, encode and express the complete donor MHC class I and class II regions (or selected classical loci such as H-2Kb, Db, Ab). Restrict expression to thymic epithelial precursors if necessary. Any donor whose MHC class I and II sequences match the ectopically expressed transgenic donor-MHC casette would be tolerated. This could open up acceptance to tissue grafts and organ donation from those donors with matching MHC regions.

* germline encode BCR data for earlier head-start immunity against common antigens. "genomic vaccination"? See [[cell therapy]] for more information about this idea.

* TODO: DRACO for cellular apoptosis instead of leaking interferon everywhere for an immune response. Immediately kills any cell that a virus infects.

* TODO: improved anti-cancer apoptosis stuff

* TODO: downloadable immunity via germline-delivered genetic program to accept lysosome or exosomes carrying antibody fragment plasmids, incorporate into B cells or immune system to generate antibodies based on the given antibody fragment. Use infrastructure outside the human body to develop these antibody fragment plasmids, or find someone who has antibodies for a specific target, then deliver to germline modified humans.

* Cas9 immunity, Cas9 tolerance (be permissive or restrictive about future CRISPR dosages), possibly via dCas9 expression in bone marrow, possibly also want to express deactivated versions of the other CRISPR systems too...

* TODO: make B and T cells more easily reprogrammable in vivo, such as through DREADD targeting or something gating a natural competence pore, or some other technique.

* endogenous cellular CRISPR immune system? nah...

* TODO: reduce acute inflammatory shock like closed airways?

### Digestion of branching carbohydrates

Alpha-galactosidase expression for the digestion of branching carbohydrates.

Humans are unsuited to digesting some types of branching carbohydrates, which then pass through the intestines and feed annoying bacteria. Not a huge priority, but with the increased metabolic demands from the muscle-enhancing therapies, it can't hurt.

<a name="lactose" />
### Lactose tolerance and lactase persistence

<http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs4988235>
<http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs4988235(C;C)>

Also known as "C/T(-13910)", and located in the MCM6 gene but with influence on the lactase LCT gene, rs4988235 is one of two SNPs that is associated with the primary haplotype associated with hypolactasia, more commonly known as lactose intolerance in European Caucasian populations. [PMID 11788828], [PMID 15114531]

In these populations, the rs4988235(T) allele is both the more common allele and the one associated with lactase persistence; individuals who are rs4988235(C;C) are likely to be lactose intolerant. In populations of sub-Saharan Africans, though, the rs4988235(T) allele is so rare that it's unlikely to be predictive of lactase persistence, and other SNPs are predictive instead.

#### Resistance to weight gain from high-fat diets (APOA5)

<a href="http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs662799">rs662799</a> increases risk of heart attack, but contributes towards preventing weight gain from high fat diets.

body fat distribution SNPs - <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/18/304030">ref</a>

lipodystrophy is a disease where the body cannot store fat properly at all leading to near-total absence of adipose tissue. Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy (extremely low body fat, severe insulin resistance, muscle hypertrophy, heaptomegaly fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia) is associated with mutations in AGPAT12 and BSCL2 (which encodes septin, which is critical for adipocyte development).

### Smell, olfactory perception, hyperosmia, macrosmia

rs6591536 - detection of β-ionone (floral) fragrance

rs1953558 - sensitivity to sweaty odor (isovaleric acid)

TODO: other hyperosmia (increased odor sensitivity) alleles? other hyperosmia in general?

TODO: see IRC logs for more information about olfactory neurons, olfactory cells, receptors, and canine olfactory receptor genetics that could be copied over to human.

Olfaction in humans is molecularly mediated by GPCRs (olfactory receptors). In insects, olfactory receptors are an unrelated group of ligand-gated ion channels.

Olfaction bypasses the thalamus and goes straight to cortical and limbic areas. Olfactory receptor neurons -> olfactory bulb -> piriform cortex and amygdala etc

[Kv1.3 -/- mice have a 1,000- to 10,000-fold lower threshold for detection of odors](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2737549/) and an increased ability to discriminate between odorants

TODO: simple transplantation of olfactory receptor genes from elephant or dog.

TODO: machine learning or computational design of olfactory receptor genes and insert a few thousand of these into the human genome. Instead of relying on existing olfactory genes found in nature, we could target various compounds that are of high human interest.

number of olfactory receptor genes by species: cow 1186, opossum 1188, rat 1207, elephant 1948, koala 1500, human 400, dogs 1100, pigs 1100; dogs, which are reputed to have good sense of smell, do not have the largest number of functional olfactory receptor genes.

dog:

* dog macrosmia might be due to [airflow in the nasal cavity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871809/).
* "1/8 of a dog's brain is devoted to analyzing smells"
* "canine olfactory bulb is 40x larger than in humans (relative to total brain size)"
* "A bloodhound can detect 1 part per 10 trillion, roughly equivalent to detecting a single drop of blood diluted in 20 olympic-sized swimming pools."
* if the canine olfactory limit is one part per trillion for certain molecular targets, then the operational scent threshold limit might be closer to one part per billion or worse depending on dog training, dog/handler teamwork efficiency, distractions, etc.
* [olfactory imprinting](https://gnusha.org/logs/2025-07-02.log) and neural coding of olfactory signals to neural discrimination puts a damper on neuralink olfactory sensor plans? this seems like an easy one or two orders of magnitude performance improvement on scent tracking tasks if by using neuralink you can decouple signal detection from animal behavior.

TODO: Develop a recombinase-driven genetic circuit that enables olfactory sensory neurons to stochastically assemble novel olfactory receptor variants from modular gene segment, analogous to immune V(D)J recombination. Make a biologically plausible strategy to generate in vivo receptor diversity and systematically enhace odor sensitivity and selectivity. Can we make a way to perceive viruses by smelling their protein capsid shell? Can we make a way to smell new nano-objects that were not genomically encoded via our pre-exisitng olfactory receptors? Take inspiration from in vivo affinity maturation, V(D)J recombination, CRISPR bacterial immune system memory, [(synthetic recombineering) diversity-generating retroelements](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.24.644984v1), [(synthetic) shufflons (site-specific recombinase card shuffles)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.25.620183v2), PilV pilus tip reprogramming, pilus sequence recombination schemes in bacteria, segmental gene conversion from silent cassettes, antigenic variation schemes, [CRISPR-X](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27798611/), [TRACE / T7-RNAP-guided mutagenesis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21876-z), [CoMuTER (Type I-E Cas3 mutagenesis)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39087-z), various [base editor and prime editor randomization](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10828429/) toolkits... possibly there are some in vivo continuous evolution and mutagenesis schemes that might be appropriate, but many seem to either have an in vitro step or are intended for in vitro environments instead of in living animal, like [in vivo affinity maturation of edited B cell repetoires (BCRs)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01184-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com)...

### Ocular system

#### Eye color (iris color)

green eye color - <a href="http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs7495174">rs7495174</a>

blue eye color - <a href="http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs12913832">rs12913832</a>

[loss of SLC45A2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0129273&utm_source=chatgpt.com) reduces melanosome pH and lightens pigmentation.

OCA2-HERC2 region on chromosome 15, which tunes melanosome pH and tyrosine activity

melanogenesis enzymes - TYR/TYRP1/DCT

transporters that set melanosome ion balance - OCA2, SLC45A2, SLC24A

PMEL organelle scaffolding proteins play a role here too.

In the back of the eye, the fundus color comes from melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid, plus the macula's yellow carotenoids (lutein/zeaxanthin) that are taken up by receptors like SCARB1 and CD36.

iris melanocytes: the iris looks brown when iris melanocytes have lots of eumelanin. With very little stromal melanin, shorter wavelengths are scattered in the collagenous stroma (Tyndall/Rayleigh scattering), so eyes look blue/gray even though there’s no blue pigment. Intermediate amounts and some long wavelengths reflectance produce green/hazel iris. ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9154287/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

TYRP1 and DCT/TYRP2 steer eumelanin chemistry. TYR (tyrosinase) is rate-limiting for [eumelanin production](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8516112/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Severe loss of TYRP1, DCT/TYRP2 causes forms of oculocutaneous albinism with very light irides.

OCA2 (P protein) forms/controls an anion conductance on the melanosome and raises lumenal pH; [reduced OCA2 function](https://elifesciences.org/articles/04543?utm_source=chatgpt.com) acidifies melanosomes, suppresses TYR, and lightens color. The famous enhancer SNP rs12913832 in HERC2 intron 86 lowers OCA2 expression in iris melanocytes and is the strongest common predictor of blue/light eyes. SLC45A2 (MATP) also helps neutralize melanosome pH; reduced function lightens pigmentation. SLC24A4 (NCKX4), a cation exchanger, is associated with eye color in GWAS and phenotyping panels.

transcriptional control of melanogenesis is via MITF, an enhancer variant near IRF4 alters TFAP2A/MITF cooperation and modulates TYR expression in melanocytes, and therefore impacts pigmentation.

PMEL builds the fibrillar matrix on which eumelanin is deposited; [disrupting PMEL](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3633693/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) affects melanosome maturation and visible pigment density. PMEL disruption causes inefficient pigment deposition leading to a lighter colored iris.

TPC2 (two-pore channel) tends to acidify melanosomes. higher TPC2 activity could reduce TYR activity.

brown iris color: high TYR pathway throughput + neutral-ish melanosome pH (OCA2/SLC45A2 set to "on"), densely melanized melanosomes leading to strong absorption. more melanin synthesis including TYR, TYRP1, DCT.

blue/gray iris color: low stromal melanin; structural scattering dominates in the stroma. blue is caused by lowers OCA2, while more OCA2 leads to darker pigmentation. less melanin synthesis for blue/gray.

green/hazel/amber: intermediate melanin + scattering; subtle shifts in eumelanin/pheomelanin balance and stromal optics.

melanosome pH (transporter) SLC45A2 (MATP) knockdown or mutation causes more acidification and therefore lighter iris color.

[melanosome cation balance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3694299/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) via SLC24A4 (NCKX4) mutations modulates pigment output.

[negative pH regulator TPC2](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/15/8273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), a channel that tends to acidify melanosomes, at higher activity level causes less melanin biogenesis.

more carotenoids like SCARB1, CD36 or receptors transporting lutein/zeaxanthin into retina causes denser macular yellow coloration.

For human eye color it is mostly about quantitative tuning of melanin plus stromal light scattering.

#### Anti-myopia

see <http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003299> "Sixteen of the novel associations are in or near genes implicated in eye development, neuronal development and signaling, the visual cycle of the retina, and general morphology: BMP3, BMP4, DLG2, DLX1, KCNMA1, KCNQ5, LAMA2, LRRC4C, PRSS56, RBFOX1, RDH5, RGR, SFRP1, TJP2, ZBTB38, and ZIC2".

#### Spectrum expansion and tetrachromacy

introduce an additional, spectrally distinct cone pigment (e.g., deliver an L-opsin into a subset of M-cones, or vice-versa; or add a tuned variant).

adult primate brains can exploit a new cone class without developmental rewiring. [AAV L-opsin delivery](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2782927/?utm_source=chatgpt.com); therefore, is a germline change required? taking hundreds of gene therapies is probably not ideal, so including extra L-opsin in the genome could make sense.

lots of available opsins from other animals, like tetrachromatic reptiles or birds.

#### Near-infrared vision

TRP has been added to mouse retinal cells for near-infrared vision, but not infrared vision. [TRPV1 in human retinal organoids](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40885666/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) also for near-infrared.

often temperature-gated TRP channels (TRPA1 and TRPV1) are used in combination with gold nanorods to get near-infrared vision.

near-infrared vision in humans can be done by upconversion nanoparticles or [lenses that convert infrared to visible light](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867425004544?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Can these upconversion nanoparticles be proteins produced by human retinal cells?

#### Infrared vision

Pit viper snakes like pythons and boas have specialized infrared-detecting pit organs with TRPA1 (transient receptor potential ankyrin 1) gene variants. These thermoreceptive TRPA1 channels are highly thermal sensitive that can detect temperature differences as small as 0.003 celsius. these receptors probably need to sit far away from vasculature so that they respond to radiant heat instead of internal body temperature variations.

The thermosensitive pit organ in snake has an external face membrane that looks out toward the air, and an internal face membrane that looks toward the underlying air-filled chamber. Warm arterial blood is prohibited from reaching the membrane. The temperature difference across the two faces is what the snake's thermosensitive receptors are measuring.

Fire-seeking jewel beetle (Melanophila acuminata) carries arrays of [photo-mechanosensitive "infrared sensilla"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003590050210?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Infrared warms a nanostructure, causing tiny mechanical changes that gate a mechanoreceptor. The principle is based on thermal expansion of many small dome-enclosed fluid-filled cavity converting infrared flux into a mechanosensory signal transduced via stretch-activated ion channels on a protein-chitin receptor membrane. Beetles can detect forest fires from many kilometers away. Various other insects have similar thermoception capabilities.

The infrared sensilla of the fire-seeking jewel beetle Melanophila acuminata are dome-shaped cuticular depressions, 12–15 µm in diameter, each housing a single, 200 µm-long, fluid-filled sensory organ composed of ≈70 mechanosensory neurons whose dendrites terminate on a thin (≈200 nm) protein–chitin receptor membrane that is mechanically deformed by the rapid (≈5 ms) thermal expansion of a fluid-filled cavity beneath the dome, converting minute (≈25 mK) infrared flux into a mechanosensory signal transduced via stretch-activated ion channels.

A microbolometer is a tiny, uncooled thermal sensor that detects infrared radiation by measuring the temperature-induced resistance change in a suspended microstructure. Can we make one out of proteins attached to an ion channel? infrared [[optogenetics]]? possibly a protein for this purpose could be evolved via in vitro directed evolution. could an aptamer do it? use knowledge of [[protein engineering]], [[optogenetics]], cytochrome C, chlorophyll, photosystems, etc.

maybe thermoresponsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) can be attached to a mechanosensitive channel (Piezo1). these ELPs have been used as [genetically encoded thermosensors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96049-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (ELP-TEMP) and as thermogenetic actuators in cells.

[cytochrome c protein as a potential sensing material for long-wavelength bolometers](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3871064/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) -- "We simulated and experimentally proved high infrared absorption of cytochrome c in the wavelength between 8 μm and 14 μm."

maybe use triplet-triplet annihilation in a protein assembly like in "[Photon upconversion supramolecular assemblies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39069661/)", however this seems to be mostly near-infrared-excitable not infrared-excitable.

#### Other ocular

include day-specific vision changes, night-specific changes, maybe choose one per eye?

extra eye, retina and optic nerve

more retinal ganglion cells, increase visual acuity? lense-related enhancements?

See [[biosight]] for more ocular enhancement notes.

#### Hair follicles and hair growth

* Colossal [demonstrated](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.03.641227v1.full#F1) editing genes associated with wooly hair in wooly mammoths with multiplex-edited mouse models with loss of function mutations in Tgm3, Fzd6, Astn2, Fam83g, Fgf5, Tgfa and Mc1r and missense mutations in keratin genes Krt25 and Krt27.

* a mutation in P2YR5 (a G protein-coupled receptor) is associated with woolly hair
* trichohyalin (TCHH) (a single-stranded α-helical protein with two or three highly repetitive regions) strengthens the hair follicle; TCHH mutants are associated with [straight hair](https://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-92970900464-9) in europeans. possibly rs17646946, rs11803731, rs4845418, rs12130862. Some smaller effects seen by WNT10A and FRAS1. TCHH is a major structural protein of the inner root sheath (IRS) and medulla.
* Asian-specific alleles of the EDAR and FGFR2 genes are associated with thick straight hair; EDAR is associated with hair thickness. [EDAR V370A](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/17/6/835/601141?utm_source=chatgpt.com) is associated with straight and thick hair.

* Long-hair phenotypes / anagen prolongation - FGF5, a catagen trigger; human loss-of-function causes trichomegaly (very long eyelashes) and generally prolongs anagen.

some other things to consider doing:

* knock-down androgen receptors in dermal papilla cells in scalp
* 5-α-reductase deficienc but only in hair: reduce SRD5A2 (type-2 5-α-reductase) in dermal papilla, connective tissue sheath, outer root sheath.
* block the production of DKK1 (a Wnt antagonist) in dermal papilla cells, or block its action in epithelial LRP5/6. DHT induces DKK1 in balding DP, and DKK1 drives keratinocyte apoptosis and anagen to catagen regression.
* block or reduce expression of IL-6 and TGFB1 in dermal papilla cells in scalp, or block their receptors in matrix/bulge keratinocytes.
* lower PTGDS (PGD2 synthase) locally and/or block GPR44 on follicular cells

hair pro-growth pathways:

* boost Wnt/beta-catenin in dermal papilla cells or epithelium. blocking secreted Wnt inhibitors (SFRP1, DKK1) enhances human hair growth ex vivo.
* in the follicular epithelium, human FGF5 loss-of-function leads to trichomegaly (long hair)
* increase local VEGF expression for angiogenesis in outer root sheath keratinocytes around baldness-prone follicles.
* in bulge or outer root sheath epithelium, JAK initiates anagen in mice and boosts growth signals in human follicles ex vivo.

TODO:

* hair growth rate modulation? human hair follicles grow at a rate of about 10,000 nm/hour. can we pattern hair types, growth rates, etc, to different skin patches or regions? hair where we want it, and not where we don't?
* what about: TET-expression control of inducible hair follicle coloration?
* genetic inducible hair follicle style switching (switch between curly, wavy, woolly, straight, thick, etc.)
* what about using hair follicle coloring as a molecular sensor of metabolites, drugs, hormones, or other circulating blood factors?
* human hair drug testing is already a thing; hair drug testing is also used in wildlife and livestock ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35112231/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* what about a [[lineage tracing]] system that works in the hair follicle bulb, or hair matrix, such that the matrix generates cells that encode information about the molecular environment, and then that information is then transferred into keratin filaments inside each of those cells that ultimately make up the human hair follicle? or otherwise makes the data available via DNA sequencing (although a system where a simple optical microscope can extract information would be better).
* what about using modified keratin filaments inside of cortical keratinocytes as a protein molecular recording device of cellular state, then use protein sequencing (or optical microscope?) to extract information about cellular history, see [analog recording of gene regulation dynamics over weeks using intracellular protein tapes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.10.653182v1.abstract). Can this be done with keratin filaments instead? or as an alternative to keratin filaments inside hair follicles? or done with stereocilia, chitinous chaeta, etc? "CytoTape is a living "protein ticker-tape" molecular memory device: a long intracellular protein filament or thread that grows continuously from one end made up of multiple sections or beads. Each bead can carry a short, unique peptide tag whose appearance is dictated by a chosen promoter. When the promoter is active, the tag is made, it is then threaded onto the growing tip, and it is then locked in place. Because growth proceeds at a steady nanometers-per-hour rate, distance from the tip automatically encodes elapsed time. Multiple events can be recorded in parallel on the same filament using simultaneous recording of five distinct tags. After days or weeks the cell is fixed, the filament is stained with tag-specific antibodies conjugated to distinct fluorophores, and a diffraction-limited microscopy line scan converts spatial position (distance from the tip) into a temporal trace of each promoter's activity. This yields multiplexed, single-cell analog recordings."
* in insects and arthropods, epidermal trichogen cells generate a "cellular hair", like for mechanosensory hairs; these hairs are chitinous chaeta or cuticular outgrowths.
* human inner ear "hair cells" produce hair which is not a keratinocyte type hair follicle; each hair cell carries or protrudes a hair bundle made of dozens of stereocilia (actin-based microvili) and not keratin shafts. there's stereocilia (unbranched actin filaments), kinocilium (microtubule-based cilium), and outer hair cells. Various studies have used cellular hair protrusions as a biosensor recorder: [ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6575585/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8789910/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [kidney cilia](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43002-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [in vivo cilia labeling](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3700774/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ciliary targeting sequences for transmembrane proteins](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11240719/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [bacterial flagellar filaments](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22447900/) with flagellin that travels through a 2 nm central hole, [amyloid fibers](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2634518/?utm_source=chatgpt.com),  ... this gets you cilium-based expression profiling or recording.
* what about using tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) for recording cellular information?
* In cancer biology, microtentacles are extremely thin, actin-rich membrane projections that form on the surface of detached or circulating cancer cells. These are not classical filopedia or invadopedia; instead, microtentacles are tubulin-based structures enriched in detyrosinated α-tubulin and EB1. Microtentacles extend for tens of micrometers from the cell body and persist for hours or days.
* what is the longest single cell hair that has been produced or discovered? very long cilia? very long chitinous growth from a cell?
* neurons: use cellular cilia extrusion length segment types to record information about neuronal cell internal/external microenvironment.
* could single hair protrusions or cilium be used for protein purification? just collect the cilia from the cells?
* ribosome-level cellular event recorder using promiscuous codons (or a subet of promiscuous codons that are based on cell expression activity) to incorporate data into a growing amino acid chain

## Skin

Albinism is probably the easiest way to go here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculocutaneous_albinism#Types">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculocutaneous_albinism#Types</a>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo#Causes">Vitiligo</a> seems to be related to a mutation in tyrosinase (TYR), similar to albinism. In vitiligo, there is a destruction of melanocytes.

melanosome transfer disorder, creating localized spots of depigmentation - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus_depigmentosus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus_depigmentosus</a>

"Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes and it is the main determinant of the skin color of darker-skinned humans. The skin color of people with light skin is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the dermis and by the hemoglobin circulating in the veins of the dermis. Humans with naturally occurring light skin have varied amounts of smaller and scarcely distributed eumelanin and its lighter-coloured relative, pheomelanin. The concentration of pheomelanin varies highly within populations from individual to individual, but it is more commonly found among East Asians, Native Americans, and Northern Europeans with red hair."

"Organelles which contain pigments, called melanosomes, are smaller and less numerous in light-skinned humans."

* "Inhibition of melanosome transfer results in skin lightening" <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15409418">ref</a>
* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism#Genetics">albinism genetics</a> - OCA1, OCA2; "A mutation in the human TRP-1 gene may result in the deregulation of melanocyte tyrosinase enzymes, a change that is hypothesized to promote brown versus black melanin synthesis."

"Variations in the KITL gene have been positively associated with about 20% of melanin concentration differences between African and non-African populations. One of the alleles of the gene has an 80% occurrence rate in Eurasian populations. The ASIP gene has a 75–80% variation rate among Eurasian populations compared to 20–25% in African populations. Variations in the SLC24A5 gene account for 20–25% of the variation between dark and light skinned populations of Africa, and appear to have arisen as recently as within the last 10,000 years. The Ala111Thr or rs1426654 polymorphism in the coding region of the SLC24A5 gene reaches fixation in Europe, but is found across the globe, particularly among populations in Northern Africa, the Horn of Africa, West Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. Whilst not all of these genes directly affect melanin production, most of them code for proteins that may play a significant role in melanogenesis and control melanin concentration. Some of these genes are found to be more prevalent in certain population than others."

"the SLC24A5 gene account for 20–25% of the variation between dark and light skinned populations of Africa"

"The characteristic of fair skin, red hair, and freckling is associated with high amount of pheomelanin, little amounts of eumelanin. This phenotype is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. However, variations in the MC1R gene sequence only have considerable influence on pigmentation in populations where red hair and extremely fair skin is prevalent. The gene variation’s primary effect is to promote eumelanin synthesis at the expense of pheomelanin synthesis, although this contributes to very little variation in skin reflectance between different ethnic groups. Melanocytes from light skin cells cocultured with keratinocytes give rise to a distribution pattern characteristic of light skin."

We focus on melanosome biogenesis, transport and transfer, melanogenic regulators in melanocytes and factors derived from keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, hormones, inflammatory cells and nerves. Enzymatic components of melanosomes include tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 and dopachrome tautomerase, which depend on the functions of OA1, P, MATP, ATP7A and BLOC-1 to synthesize eumelanins and pheomelanins. The main structural component of melanosomes is Pmel17/gp100/Silv, whose sorting involves adaptor protein 1A (AP1A), AP1B, AP2 and spectrin, as well as a chaperone-like component, MART-1. During their maturation, melanosomes move from the perinuclear area toward the plasma membrane. Microtubules, dynein, kinesin, actin filaments, Rab27a, melanophilin, myosin Va and Slp2-a are involved in melanosome transport. Foxn1 and p53 up-regulate skin pigmentation via bFGF and POMC derivatives including α-MSH and ACTH, respectively. Other critical factors that affect skin pigmentation include MC1R, CREB, ASP, MITF, PAX3, SOX9/10, LEF-1/TCF, PAR-2, DKK1, SCF, HGF, GM-CSF, endothelin-1, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, neurotrophins and neuropeptides. UV radiation up-regulates most factors that increase melanogenesis. Further studies will elucidate the currently unknown functions of many other pigment genes/proteins."

For primates, very risky to do GH/GHRH upregulation or SOCS2 loss of function for GH hypersensitivity.

In human, FGFR3 partial loss of function and NPR3 loss of function both increase height but come with skeletal disproportions.

Instead, consider CNP-NPR2 signaling like with NPR2 gain-of-function or CNP related changes.

Focus genetic modifications on epiphyseal growth-plate chondrocytes, espcially the columnar proliferative and pre-hypertrophic zones, because that is where endochrondal elongation is programmed. Activating [NPR2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9024524/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) increases stature and CNP analogs raise growth velocity assuming open plates.

perfect pitch - <a href="https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs3057">rs3057</a> near 8q24

increase [inner hair cell (IHC) nerve synapses](https://elifesciences.org/articles/03564?utm_source=chatgpt.com): boosting neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3/NT-3) in the cochlea increases IHC ribbon-synapse density and the amplitude of sound-evoked neural potentials. In mice, this causes better auditory processing relative to wildtype mice.

increase resistance to acoustic injury via [overexpression of the α9 nicotinic receptor subunit on outer hell cells (OHCs)](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/22/24/10838?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

hair cell regeneration, ATOH1 gene therapy?

[Sox2 overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8883703/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) alleviates noise-induced hearing loss by inhibiting inflammation-related hair cell apoptosis.

prestin modifications for ultrasonic hearing? various other mechanotransduction components. increase mechanosensitivity of hair cells?

increase hearing range? various outer hair cell (OHC) mechanotransduction tweaks, like hair stiffness, resonance, and ion channel kinetics in stereocilia on hair cells. Grow a wider range of hair types, including shorter hairs and longer hairs.

engineer various variants of the mechanosensors.

engineered prestin motor protein kinetics. copy from bat?

consider bat-derived actin-binding proteins or espin, fascin-2, or beta-actin variants knocked into human OHCs.

in OHCs, replace TMC1/2 isoforms with fast-gating variants from dolphins or echolocating bats.

for tectorial membrane stiffness modification, can this be done surgically? collagen-based hydrogel as a replacement maybe? basal turn implants?

## Working memory

The polymorphisms rs1800497 and rs2283265 (also known as the Taq1a polymorphism) near the dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) gene are <a href="http://www.klingberglab.se/pub/Soderqvist_2013.pdf">associated</a> with improvements during working memory training. (rs1800497(C;C) better avoidance of errors).
However this polymorphism comes with serious tradeoffs: antisocial, borderline, dissocial, and avoidant personality disorders, addictive and impulsive behaviors such as binge eating, pathological gambling, and drug abuse. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANKK1#A1.2B_allele">(more)</a>

DRD2: "DRD2 A1/A1 genotype had a significantly higher intelligence than A2/A2 carriers [81]. In addition, a relationship between the striatal dopamine receptor D2 and verbal intelligence quotient was found [82]." (Tsai, S.-J., Yu, Y.W.-Y., Lin, C.-H., Chen, T.-J., Chen, S.-P., and Hong, C.-J., Neuropsychobiology, 2002, vol. 45, no. 3, pp. 128–130.) (Guo, J.F., Yang, Y.K., Chiu, N.T., Yeh, T.L., Chen, P.S., Lee, I.H., and Chu, C.L., Psychol. Med., 2006, vol. 36, no. 4, pp. 547–554.)

"... our results indicate that the human genes encoding adenylyl cyclase 8 (ADCY8), the γ catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PRKACG), the γ subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2G), 2a and 2b subunits of the ionotropic NMDA glutamate receptor (GRIN2A, GRIN2B), metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3), and protein kinase C α (PRKCA) are important for human memory function, because variability among these genes was specifically associated with memory performance and with activation in memory-related brain regions."

* chromosome 10 [high IQ via ADAM12 mutants](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2017121) rs4962322, rs4962520, and rs10794073 explaining up to 1% of high IQ but it may have no impact on IQ in the normal range. ADAM12 can "shed" HB-EGF, an EGFR ligand. HB-EGF/EGFR signaling supports hippocampal plasticity and learning. ADAM12 cleaves IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-3/-5), increasing free IGF available to activate IGF1 receptors. IGF1 signaling is strongly implicated in synaptic plasticity, LTP and memory across animal and human studies. Reports exist of ADAM12 expression in oligodendrocyte lineage cells and during demyelination.

* [plexins](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2017121) gene family showed a significant association with high IQ. Plexins are transmembrane proteins which act as receptors to semaphorins. The plexin-semaphorin pathway has been linked to axon guidance, neural connectivity, axon regeneration in the central nervous system, mental disability, bone disorders, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. Consider regulation of semaphorin receptor activity. Consider different expression in brain-expressed genes and their regulatory reasons, instead of whole body.

The shift in cognitive performance was associated with smaller whole brain volume (uncorrected p = 0.046) and lower connectivity by resting state functional MRI in the visual network (FDR corrected p = 0.027) ... direct allele carriers harbor a more efficient brain consistent with the cellular biology of actin cytoskeleton and synaptic gain of function."; CHRFAM7A is also mentioned in ["lineage-specific copy number variations article"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC449870/).

It is not clear to me whether the improved cognitive phenotype is linked to RIMS1, PROM1, both, or neither.

[Transgenic rhesus monkeys carrying the human MCPH1 gene copies show human-like neoteny of brain development](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/6/3/480/5420749) -- "Brain size and cognitive skills are the most dramatically changed traits in humans during evolution and yet the genetic mechanisms underlying these human-specific changes remain elusive. Here, we successfully generated 11 transgenic rhesus monkeys (8 first-generation and 3 second-generation) carrying human copies of MCPH1, an important gene for brain development and brain evolution. Brain-image and tissue-section analyses indicated an altered pattern of neural-cell differentiation, resulting in a delayed neuronal maturation and neural-fiber myelination of the transgenic monkeys, similar to the known evolutionary change of developmental delay (neoteny) in humans. Further brain-transcriptome and tissue-section analyses of major developmental stages showed a marked human-like expression delay of neuron differentiation and synaptic-signaling genes, providing a molecular explanation for the observed brain-developmental delay of the transgenic monkeys. More importantly, the transgenic monkeys exhibited better short-term memory and shorter reaction time compared with the wild-type controls in the delayed-matching-to-sample task. The presented data represent the first attempt to experimentally interrogate the genetic basis of human brain origin using a transgenic monkey model and it values the use of non-human primates in understanding unique human traits."

[BEC1/KCNH3 knockout enhances cognitive function](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/29/46/14637) -- "The K+ channel, one of the determinants for neuronal excitability, is genetically heterogeneous, and various K+ channel genes are expressed in the CNS. The therapeutic potential of K+ channel blockers for cognitive enhancement has been discussed, but the contribution each K+ channel gene makes to cognitive function remains obscure. BEC1 (KCNH3) is a member of the K+ channel superfamily that shows forebrain-preferential distribution. Here, we show the critical involvement of BEC1 in cognitive function. BEC1 knock-out mice performed behavioral tasks related to working memory, reference memory, and attention better than their wild-type littermates. Enhanced performance was also observed in heterozygous mutants. The knock-out mice had neither the seizures nor the motor dysfunction that are often observed in K+ channel-deficient mice. In contrast to when it is disrupted, overexpression of BEC1 in the forebrain caused the impaired performance of those tasks. It was also found that altering BEC1 expression could change hippocampal neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. The results indicate that BEC1 may represent the first K+ channel that contributes preferentially and bidirectionally to cognitive function."

SP0535: [A human-specific de novo gene promotes cortical expansion and folding](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.202204140) -- "Here, a human-specific de novo gene, SP0535, is identified that is preferentially expressed in the ventricular zone of the human fetal brain and plays an important role in cortical development and function. In human embryonic stem cell-derived cortical organoids, knockout of SP0535 compromises their growth and neurogenesis. In SP0535 transgenic (TG) mice, expression of SP0535 induces fetal cortex expansion and sulci and gyri-like structure formation. The progenitors and neurons in the SP0535 TG mouse cortex tend to proliferate and differentiate in ways that are unique to humans. SP0535 TG adult mice also exhibit improved cognitive ability and working memory. Mechanistically, SP0535 interacts with the membrane protein Na+/K+ ATPase subunit alpha-1 (ATP1A1) and releases Src from the ATP1A1-Src complex, allowing increased level of Src phosphorylation that promotes cell proliferation. Thus, SP0535 is the first proven human-specific de novo gene that promotes cortical expansion and folding, and can function through incorporating into an existing conserved molecular network."

NOTCH2NL overexpression: [Human-specific notch2nl genes expand cortical neurogenesis through delta/notch regulation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6092419/); NOTCH2NLB overexpression leads to clonal expansion of human cortical progenitors. -- "The cerebral cortex underwent rapid expansion and increased complexity during recent hominid evolution. Gene duplications constitute a major evolutionary force, but their impact on human brain development remains unclear. Using tailored RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we profiled the spatial and temporal expression of hominid-specific duplicated (HS) genes in the human fetal cortex and identified a repertoire of 35 HS genes displaying robust and dynamic patterns during cortical neurogenesis. Among them **NOTCH2NL**, human-specific paralogs of the NOTCH2 receptor, stood out for their ability to promote cortical progenitor maintenance. NOTCH2NL promote the clonal expansion of human cortical progenitors, ultimately leading to higher neuronal output. At the molecular level, NOTCH2NL function by activating the Notch pathway through inhibition of cis Delta/Notch interactions. Our study uncovers a large repertoire of recently evolved genes active during human corticogenesis and reveals how human-specific NOTCH paralogs may have contributed to the expansion of the human cortex."

* IGF-2 (insulin-like growth factor 2), but only for memory consolidation

"The role of non-coding RNA in memory formation has been reported in a number of publications [46, 47]. RNA-mediated “memory transfer” was recently demonstrated in the marine mollusk Aplysia [48]. Total RNA was extracted from neurons of Aplysia subjected to sensitization training by tail electroshock and injected into neurons of naive mollusks. Snails injected with the RNA of the trained snails showed higher levels of siphon withdrawal reflex as compared to the control group. These data confirm the epigenetic hypothesis of memory formation and can be used in future studies on the possibility of memory stimulation."

"α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors functionally coupled with NMDA receptors are other popular targets in the studies on memory strengthening. Chemical activation of AMPA receptors by ampakines (benzamides, benzothiadiazines, biaryl propylsulfonamides, 3-trifluoromethylpyrazoles) have been found to facilitate memory (for detailed review, see [10]). AMPA receptors are regulated by the protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ), a product of the PKCζ gene in the brain, that has been shown to affect the long-term memory storage in invertebrates and vertebrates (see review [11]). For example, overexpression of PKMζ in the rat neocortex enhanced long-term memory, whereas the dominant negative PKMζ with amino acid substitution in the active site disrupted memory [12]. In monkeys, higher levels of PKMζ were associated with more accurate recognition memory [13]. "

"Another popular target in the memory improvement studies is cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor that regulates expression of immediate early genes, such as c-Fos and zif268. In general, any manipulation that that leads to the upregulation of CREB expression results in memory enhancement. To give a few examples, local overexpression of CREB in the basolateral amygdala enhanced memory in the classic fear conditioning [14] and social defeat [15] tests. Overexpression of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV) that directly regulates CREB in the forebrain of mice improved memory in the social recognition and Morris water maze tests [16, 17]. CCAAT/enhancerbinding protein (C/EBP), a product of the early C/EBP gene, is involved in the activation of late response genes in synaptic plasticity. Upregulation of C/EBP expression enhances memory performance. Thus, suppression of the negative C/EBP regulator, ATF4, improved performance of the experimental animals in the Morris water maze test [18]."

"Among many attempts to find chemical agents potentiating CREB-mediated pathways, the most productive approach to memory enhancement in AD patients involved modulation of phosphodiesterase (PDE) that negatively regulates the cAMP/CREB pathway by hydrolyzing cAMP. Hence, PDE inhibitors should enhance memory. Indeed, some PDE inhibitors, namely Rolipram and Sildenafil, have shown positive result in AD mouse models. Cilostazol a selective inhibitor of PDE3, partially prevents cognitive decline and memory loss in AD patients [19]. For more detailed information on the inhibitors on CREB-dependent pathways, see the review [20]."

Here, we studied the effects of long-term α1AAR stimulation using transgenic mice engineered to express a constitutively active mutant (CAM) form of the α1AAR. CAM-α1AAR mice showed enhancements in several behavioral models of learning and memory. In contrast, mice that have the α1AAR gene knocked out displayed poor cognitive function. Hippocampal brain slices from CAM-α1AAR mice demonstrated increased basal synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation, and long-term potentiation compared with wild-type (WT) mice. WT mice treated with the α1AAR-selective agonist cirazoline also showed enhanced cognitive functions. In addition, CAM-α1AAR mice exhibited antidepressant and less anxious phenotypes in several behavioral tests compared with WT mice. Furthermore, the lifespan of CAM-α1AAR mice was 10% longer than that of WT mice.

in transgenic mice, stabilized beta-catenin causes markedly enlarged brains with increased cortical surface area and even sulci/gyri–like folds.

[...] Compared with wild-type precursors, a greater proportion of transgenic precursors reenter the cell cycle after mitosis.

In this work, we analyze the transcriptomes of distinct progenitor subpopulations isolated by a cell polarity-based approach from developing mouse and human neocortex. We identify 56 genes preferentially expressed in human apical and basal radial glia that lack mouse orthologs. Among these, ARHGAP11B has the highest degree of radial glia-specific expression. ARHGAP11B arose from partial duplication of ARHGAP11A (which encodes a Rho guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein) on the human lineage after separation from the chimpanzee lineage. Expression of ARHGAP11B in embryonic mouse neocortex promotes basal progenitor generation and self-renewal and can increase cortical plate area and induce gyrification. Hence, ARHGAP11B may have contributed to evolutionary expansion of human neocortex."

To investigate whether G1 lengthening alone may cause the switch of cortical progenitors from proliferation to neurogenesis, we manipulated the expression of cdk/cyclin complexes and found that cdk4/cyclinD1 overexpression prevents G1 lengthening without affecting cell growth, cleavage plane, or cell cycle synchrony with interkinetic nuclear migration. Specifically, overexpression of cdk4/cyclinD1 inhibited neurogenesis while increasing the generation and expansion of basal (intermediate) progenitors, resulting in a thicker subventricular zone and larger surface area of the postnatal cortex originating from cdk4/cyclinD1-transfected progenitors. Conversely, lengthening of G1 by cdk4/cyclinD1-RNAi displayed the opposite effects. Thus, G1 lengthening is necessary and sufficient to switch neural progenitors to neurogenesis, and overexpression of cdk4/cyclinD1 can be used to increase progenitor expansion and, perhaps, cortical surface area."

fetal microinjection of FGF2 into embryonic ventricles (mouse E11.5) induces cortical gyrification ([Cortical gyrification induced by fibroblast growth factor 2 in the mouse brain](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3693057/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) -- "Gyrification allows an expanded cortex with greater functionality to fit into a smaller cranium. However, the mechanisms of gyrus formation have been elusive. We show that ventricular injection of FGF2 protein at embryonic day 11.5—before neurogenesis and before the formation of intrahemispheric axonal connections—altered the overall size and shape of the cortex and induced the formation of prominent, bilateral gyri and sulci in the rostrolateral neocortex. We show increased tangential growth of the rostral ventricular zone (VZ) but decreased Wnt3a and Lef1 expression in the cortical hem and adjacent hippocampal promordium and consequent impaired growth of the caudal cortical primordium, including the hippocampus. At the same time, we observed ectopic Er81 expression, increased proliferation of Tbr2-expressing (Tbr2+) intermediate neuronal progenitors (INPs), and elevated Tbr1+ neurogenesis in the regions that undergo gyrification, indicating region-specific actions of FGF2 on the VZ and subventricular zone (SVZ). However, the relative number of basal radial glia—recently proposed to be important in gyrification—appeared to be unchanged. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased radial unit production together with rapid SVZ growth and heightened localized neurogenesis can cause cortical gyrification in lissencephalic species. These data also suggest that the position of cortical gyri can be molecularly specified in mice. In contrast, a different ligand, FGF8b, elicited surface area expansion throughout the cortical primordium but no gyrification. Our findings demonstrate that individual members of the diverse Fgf gene family differentially regulate global as well as regional cortical growth rates while maintaining cortical layer structure."

BDNF transgenic mice provided the opportunity to investigate the effects of modestly increased BDNF levels on dendrite structure in the complex in vivo environment. While the elevated BDNF levels were insufficient to change levels of TrkB receptor isoforms or downstream TrkB signaling, they did increase dendrite complexity of dentate granule cells. These cells showed an increased number of first order dendrites, of total dendritic length and of total number of branch points. These results suggest that dendrite structure of granule cells is tightly regulated and is sensitive to modest increases in levels of BDNF.

By 21 days post-mitosis, exogenous neuroligin-1 was expressed at the tips of dendritic spines and increased the number of dendritic spines. Neuroligin-1-overexpressing cells showed a selective increase in functional excitatory synapses and connection multiplicity by single afferent fibers, as well as an increase in the synaptic AMPA/NMDA receptor ratio. In contrast to its synapse-inducing ability in vitro, neuroligin-1 overexpression did not induce precocious synapse formation in adult-born neurons. However, the dendrites of neuroligin-1-overexpressing cells did have more thin protrusions during an early period of dendritic outgrowth, suggesting enhanced filopodium formation or stabilization. Our results indicate that neuroligin-1 expression selectively increases the degree, but not the onset, of excitatory synapse formation in adult-born neurons."

[Estradiol mediates fluctuation in hippocampal synapse density during the estrous cycle in the adult rat](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/12/7/2549.full.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) -- "We have found that the density of synapses in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 region in the adult female rat is sensitive to estradiol manipulation and fluctuates naturally as the levels of ovarian steroids vary during the 5 day estrous cycle. In both cases, low levels of estradiol are correlated with lower synapse density, while high estradiol levels are correlated with a higher density of synapses. These synaptic changes occur very rapidly in that within approximately 24 hr between the proestrus and estrus stages of the estrous cycle, we observe a 32% decrease in the density of hippocampal synapses. Synapse density then appears to cycle back to proestrus values over a period of several days. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such short-term steroid-mediated synaptic plasticity occurring naturally in the adult mammalian brain." and another study [suggests](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2021-76265-001) that endogenous hippocampus estradiol not peripheral estradiol is responsible for female rat "novel object recognition" skill, however they only tested this via inhibition of the production of hippocampal estradiol via microinjection of letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) into the hippocampi of rats.

* consider maybe: Chondroitinase ABC (protein enzyme; intracortical infusion) — digests CSPGs/PNNs, reopens adult visual-cortex plasticity, enabling new synaptic connections and circuit re-wiring.
* consider maybe: Otx2 homeoprotein (protein delivered to visual cortex) — modulates PV-cell/PNN state to reopen or shift critical-period plasticity, facilitating structural/synaptic remodeling. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3268286/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* consider maybe: intrahippocampal injection of APP-alpha - improved motor learning and memory in mice.
* hippocampus or amygdala injection of Tat-GluA2\_3Y peptide (block AMPAR endocytosis and keep AMPARs at synapses)
* intracortical delivery of exosomes or extracellular vesicles?
* oxygen-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound targeting (sonoperfusion), perfluorocarbon oxygen carriers emulsions to increase cerebral oxygenation and mitochondrial function, etc
* [Intracerebral injection of extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stem cells](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770482/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* faster action potentials. faster recovery. more dendrites per neuron. more receptors per synapse (davidad says estimates are 150 to 300 receptors per human synapse), less ubiquitin, more DUB, more basal radial glia cells.

faster action potentials:

* Kv3 channel mechanisms: Kv3.1/3.2 enable ultra-fast action potential [repolarization](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4922457/?utm_source=chatgpt.com); transfection/overexpression of Kv3.1 makes normally slow neurons capable of high-rate firing.
* BK channel β4 (KCNMB4) loss narrows action potentials and alters excitability in dentate granule cells

need to double check and confirm these mouse results:

* overexpression of neuronal caveolin-1 (SynCav1) to increase dendritic arborization and synaptic preservation in aging mice?
* Cdk4 + Cyclin-D1: increasing expression of these cell-cycle genes in adult dentate gyrus expands neural stem/progenitor pools, increases adult neurogenesis, and improves memory.
* TLX (Nr2e1, orphan nuclear receptor): TLX expression expands adult hippocampal stem/progenitor cells (increased AHN) and has been linked to enhanced learning/memory in mice.

possible engineering targets:

* deubiquitinization efficiency?
* neurotransmitter receptors, binding efficiency, regulation, lifecycle stuff (production, membrane localization, (thermo)stability, destruction)
* agonists, antagonists
* copy number variations of deubiquitinization
* spinogenesis, synaptogenesis, synapse pruning, axon growth, dendritic growth, neurites, mitochondria modifications

possibly it would be better to focus on the engineering of entire systems of growth and pruning rather than just growth, unless existing pruning mechanisms can accommodate irrelevant-needs-to-be-pruned overgrowth. It is not clear if there is a specific balance or synaptic plasticity rate, or synaptogenesis rate to pruning rate etc, that needs to be hit in order to have significantly improved cognitive ability or learning.

how to better increase the information density of neurons or synapses?

Note that for overexpression of either receptors in neurons or modulated expression, either upregulated or downregulated, in any neuron can have different performance and behavioral outcomes depending on the region or type of neuron in which this different gene expression program is executed. It may be interesting to look at transcription factors and synthetic transcription factors or other promoters that are cell type specific or cell fate specific in order to get a specific effect in a specific type of neuron or in specific circuits. Likewise, modulated expression in every cell throughout the body is likely non-ideal.

[Mitochondrial origins of the pressure to sleep](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09261-y) (not a human study)

here is what gpt-o3 says about sleep pressure invulnerability: "Candidate mechanisms, supported by transgenic or knockout studies, include: (1) overexpression of adenosine kinase (ADK), which accelerates adenosine clearance and blunts its accumulation; (2) loss-of-function or dominant-negative mutations in adenosine A1 or A2A receptors, rendering sleep-promoting regions insensitive to adenosine's somnogenic signal; (3) hyperactive ENT1 transporters, which remove adenosine too efficiently from synapses; (4) mutations in mitochondrial respiratory proteins that reduce electron leak, thereby weakening the redox trigger for pressure buildup; and (5) loss of prostaglandin D2 synthesis (e.g., in PTGDS), blocking the immune-to-sleep cascade that normally amplifies pressure. Each of these could be tested via CRISPR in mice by introducing: a promoter duplication for ADK (upregulate or otherwise promote expression); a single-point mutation in Adora2a or Adora1 disrupting G-protein coupling; a gain-of-function allele in Slc29a1 (ENT1); a stabilized complex I subunit (e.g., Ndufs4) mimicking tighter coupling; or a nonsense mutation in Ptgds." .... it also says: "A microdeletion affecting the 5' regulatory region or a non-critical exon of ADK might lead to a benign, inherited suppression of sleep pressure, causing minimal systemic disruption while significantly reducing brain adenosine accumulation." but I thought adenosine kinase was used everywhere? maybe not?

## Hedonistic imperative david pearce stuff

David Pearce specifically proposed:

* modify pain sensitivity or insensitivity, see other notes on this page. david pearce is a big fan of SCN9A deletion or modification.
* in [_Hedonistic Imperative_](https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon1.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com) david pearce argues for enlarging mesolimbic dopamine circuitry, selectively boosting mu-opioid and serotonin pathway function, and disabling several countervailing inhibitory feedback processes (e.g., auto-receptors located on the same surface of the same neuron that released the neurotransmitter it responds to, often acting as a built-in inhibitory brake such as by inhibiting further synthesis or release of the neurotransmitter, a form of negative-feedback control over neuronal signaling) to raise hedonic set-points.
* remove dynorphin (aversive/kappa system) from reward circuits
* remove pro-aversive peptides (or peptidergic inputs) such as bradykinin, nociceptin/orphanin FQ, and substance P -- these are related to genes or receptors such as BDKRB1/2, OPRL1/PNOC, and TAC1/NK1R
* polygenic tuning of mood, personality, pro-social tone, hedonic set-point: consider modifications or changes related to COMT, SLC6A4 (SERT), FAAH, ADRA2B (often called the “ADRA2B deletion variant”), and OXTR.

reference table: dynorphin–κ system (PDYN/OPRK1) (stress/ahedonia), bradykinin (BDKRB1/2), nociceptin (PNOC/OPRL1), substance P (TAC1/NK1R)

"Both TET2 and DNMT3A are factors [28,29] and are thought to silence hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal to permit efficient hematopoietic differentiation [30,31]. Therefore, loss of functionality in these genes is likely to underlie an enhanced self-renewal leading to the observed age-related myeloid lineage bias. This skewing towards the myeloid lineage is assumed to have adverse effects on immune functionality in normal healthy individuals, but in the oldest old the increase of the myeloid compartment might be compensative for the age-related decrease in naive T-cells, known as immuno-senescence. Hence on condition that the enhanced self-renewal, instigated by somatic disruptive mutations in TET2 and DNMT3A, leads to increased levels of competent immune cells, be it of the myeloid lineage though, might partly compensate for the age-related loss of immuno-capacity of the lymphoid compartment."

## Strategies for engineered negligible senescence

Aubrey de Grey proposed "Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence" which includes the following:

<https://sens.org/>

[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence](https://www.lifespan.io/our-research/intro-to-sens-research/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) is a repair-based approach to aging. It consists of seven categories of molecular and cellular damage that accumulate with age and proposes targeted adult interventions to keep their levels below the threshold that causes pathology. While SENS is primarily focused on adult aging, many of the concepts can be used to inform human germline genetic engineering for anti-aging.

* cell loss (like from non-dividing cells) and atrophy requires replacement (RepleniSens) via tissue engineering and stem cell therapies to restore cell numbers and function. Stimulation or proliferation of resident progenitors to replace lost cells.
* death-resistant (senescent) cells must be removed (ApoptoSens) via targeted ablation such as through senolytic drugs or via immune/CAR-T approaches. p16-activated caspase, senolytic small molecule therapy (dasatinib, quercetin, navitoclax), immune-mediated clearance of senescent cells (CAR-NK cells, vaccination against senescent antigens).
* extracellular aggregates require immunoclearance (AmyloSENS): use vaccination/antibody therapies to tag and remove amyloids such as Aβ or transthyretin in tissue spaces. Active or passive immunization to tag aggregates for microglia/macrophage uptake. Use catalytic monoclonal antibodies or nanobodies that enhance proteolysis. Use engineered proteases like neprilysin or MMP variants. See [neprilysin overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2768427/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Enhance endogenous clearance pathways. alagebrium (ALT-711) analogue expression during thymic negative selection.
* intracellular aggregates should be digested by better lysosomes (LysoSENS) by introducing novel lysosomal enzymes (like those sourced from microbes) to digest stubborn junk like oxidized cholesterol adducts and lipofuscin that materially clog lysosomes. Genomically encode modified enzymes with better trafficking and activity, like bacterial or fungal hydrolases. Transcriptional upregulation of TFEB (master lysosomal biogenesis factor) or TFEB overexpression. Engineer pH-optimized variants of existing lysosomal enzymes. Overexpress other autophagy/lysosomal biogenesis factors. [ATG5 overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3753544/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). [Beclin-1(Becn1) F121A knock-in](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5992097/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to boost autophagy. reverse proteotoxic pathology and lipofuscin via upregulation of lysosome and TFEB programs.
* extracellular crosslinks require the matrix to be replaced or broken (GlycoSENS) via development of crosslink-brakers (such as glucosepane) or refresh extracellular matrix to restore tissue elasticity, especially in arteries. [Glyoxalase-1 (Glo1) overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12382624/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* mitochondria DNA mutations need to be bypassed (MitoSENS) by moving mtDNA genes to the nucleus (allotopic expression) and import the proteins back into mitochondria to maintain cellular respiration. Allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes into the nucleus will require recoding for cytosolic translation and also mitochondrial targeting sequences. Mitochondrial-targeted nucleases could be used to eliminate mutant genomes. Therapeutic mitochondrial transplantation or progenitor cell transfer. Engineer enhanced mitochondrial import machinery. Add mitochondrial-targeted DNA repair systems. Overexpress mitochondrial biogenesis factors (PGC-1α, NRF1/2).
* oncogenic nuclear (epi)mutations to pre-empt cancer (OncoSENS) by the "widespread interruption of lengthening of telomeres" to prevent lethal tumor overgrowth, in addition to periodic stem cell reseeding throughout the body; CRISPR/dCas9-based targeted demethylation or histone acetylation to restore youthful gene expression; possibly some epigenetic rejuvenation via transient yamanaka-factor expression for partial reprogramming but i am skeptical. tumor-suppressor genes must not be silenced, in fact they must be unsilenced, and chromatin remodeling errors must be fixed or be made to trigger apoptosis. Immune surveillance to kill pre-cancerous cells. Engineer more robust tumor suppressor networks. Add novel DNA damage sensors and response pathways. [Super p53](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/20/1/16.long?utm_source=chatgpt.com) with added extra Ink4/Arf (s-Arf/p53 mice) produced significantly longer lifespan and delayed aging.

Some of the SENS opportunities can be met via germline engineering:

* design redundant metabolic pathways to prevent single points of failure
* create "damage-proof" protein variants less prone to aggregation/oxidation
* dramatically upregulate proteostasis networks
* engineer enhanced DNA proofreading and repair machinery, like double-strand break sensor, detection, and repair, or go into apoptosis
* look for better bacterial/archaeal DNA repair systems from other organisms
* metabolic optimization: engineer more efficient electron transport chains with less ROS production
* add alternative respiratory pathways (like those in long-lived animals)
* optimize NAD+ synthesis and utilization pathways
* engineer telomerase regulation for optimal telomere maintenance
* create enhanced stem cell reserves and regenerative capacity
* import longevity genes from extremely long-lived species (bowhead whales, Greenland sharks, naked mole rats)
* add extremophile stress resistance genes
* integrate plant/bacterial antioxidant systems
* damage-resistant proteins? metabolically optimized protein encodings?
* place "stemness" genes (PAX7, LGR5, SOX2, MYC, TERT) under endogenous or synthetic stress-inducible promoters
* maintain larger stem cell pools and create a "progenitor bias" in every tissue, possibly with FOXO3 modifications or upregulation
* probably significantly more opportunities that have long been overlooked.

# Reproductive systems

<a name="fertility" />
## Fertility

the following is mostly mouse science:

* [BAX knockout (-/-) causes a greater follicular endowmnet and oocyte endowment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17616717/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* [BCL-2 overexpression in oocytes increases the primordial follicular endowment by birth](https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-abstract/64/4/1153/2723396); transgenic bcl-2 mice were generated that overexpress human bcl-2 in an effort to reduce prenatal oocyte loss. The later stage follicular pruning still occurs, of course.
* [PUMA (BBC3) knockout](https://rep.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/rep/148/2/211.xml?utm_source=chatgpt.com): increases germ cell and primordial follicle numbers in embryonic and early postnatal ovaries.
* [caspase-2 knockout or inhibition](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674%2805%2900802-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com): reduces oocyte apoptosis; knockout mice show increased oocyte survival and larger ovarian reserves in experimental settings.
* increase primordial germ cells (PGCs) founder cell count via time-tuned BMP/WNT priming of the posterior epiblast. [BMP4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC316469/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) from extraembryonic ectoderm and WNT3 give epiblast cells competence to become PGCs and induce the core specifiers PRDM1/BLIMP1, PRDM14, TFAP2C. Note that [biphasic BMP4 or conditional BMP4 happloinsufficiency or Noggin expression](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07937-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com) may be necessary to preserve PGC pool size.
* [epiblast-restricted overexpression (Sox2-CreERT2) of Prdm1/Prdm14/Tfap2c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3796875/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) during the competence window should increase the fraction of cells choosing the PGC fate.
* strengthen chemoattraction, chemotaxis and survival cues during the migration and colonization phase via [KITL-KIT upregulation in gonadal ridge or along the migration path, for motility and survival](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0730719100?utm_source=chatgpt.com); gonad- or mesentery-restricted CXCL12 overexpression or boosted CXCR4 in PGCs might increase capture efficiency; improve beta1-integrin-ECM engagement via [PGC-specific ITGB1 gain-of-function or gonadal fibronectin/laminin overexpression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10079228/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Note that migration cues and integrins are pleiotropic, so it's important to use cell-type-restricted enhancers or drivers to gate these genetic programs.
* oogonia expansion and meiotic entry timing - extend the mitotic window before meiosis during fetal development: [delay STRA8 induction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42259-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com) via transient Cyp26b1 expression in the fetal ovary or oocyte-restricted dampening of RA/STRA8 signaling, which could allow for extra mitoses to occur, then there are more oogonia available to be enclosed into primordial follicles.
* oogonia expansion and meiotic entry timing - cell-cyle acceleration in oogonia: [drive CDK4/6–Cyclin D activity or lower p21/p27 in germ cells](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/35/9-10/619.full?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to increase symmetric divisions before meiotic S-phase, ideally paired with enhanced DNA repair.
* follicle assembly and perinatal survival - expand the somatic niche (pregranulosa supply) - cortical Lgr5+ pregranulosa cells (stimulated by RSPO1–WNT4–β-catenin) proliferate ([upregulate?](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7443898/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) to provide the granulosa pool. [RSPO1 overexpression or stabilized beta-catenin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655463/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in ovarian surface epithelium/Lgr5+ lineages could enlarge the scaffold that encloses more oocytes into follicles.
* follicle assembly and perinatal survival - nudge Notch to improve cyst resolution and produce more one-oocyte follicles - [oocyte JAG1 upregulation or granulosa Notch sensitization](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3968400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) might increase efficient enclosure and reduce multi-oocyte follicles or follicular atresia.
* follicle assembly and perinatal survival - [brief prepubertal YAP1 activation in pregranulosa](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6704445/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) could enlarge early follicle support without prematurely activating the pool.
* [Review: primordial pool of follicles and nest breakdown in mammalian ovaries](https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article-abstract/15/12/795/1048275) (2009)
* oocyte apoptosis occurs around fetal/perinatal life when the germline cyst breaks down and only a subset of germ cells become oocytes.
* some oocyte apoptosis is related to DNA damage such as double-strand breaks ([oocyte DNA damage checkpoint](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5621520/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), and this should probably not be blocked, except to the extent that we can upregulate DNA damage repair (although in pools of millions of oocytes it is unclear if DNA damage repair is an important component to maintaining a large supply). Trp63 (TAp63) loss or Chek2 loss protects primordial oocytes from elimination after irradiation/chemo, if you want to preserve oocytes even with damaged DNA. There might be good reasons to want to preserve mature oocytes with damaged DNA, such as for ooplasm donation or oocyte enucleaton.
* oogonia expansion and meiotic entry timing - raise DNA repair capacity to prevent checkpoint-mediated culling: BRCA1 deficiency shrinks the oocyte reserve, while RAD51 activity promotes survival. transgenic [RAD51 or BRCA1 up-tuning](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5130338/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (oocyte-restricted, perinatal) could reduce DNA damage response (DDR)-triggered losses during/leaving meiotic prophase.
* during cyst breakdown, many nurse-like germ cells die via a non-apoptotic PCD program (acidification). acidification can be blocked pharmacologically (bafilomycin/concanamycin). In mouse perinatal ovaries, many cyst sister cells behave as nurse cells and die via a non-apoptotic, lysosome/acidification-driven PCD aided by pre-granulosa cells (V-ATPase/cathepsin–dependent).
* autophagy supports oocyte survival: [germ cell–specific ATG7 knockout](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4669757/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) causes major primordial-follicle loss (primary ovarian insufficiency phenotype).
* in growing follicles, granulosa-cell apoptosis is central to atresia. Consider altering [granulosa cell apoptosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9110309/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) programs (Fas/FasL system, caspase-3).
* [evidence for non-apoptotic RCD](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2822%2900579-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (autophagy, pyroptosis, ferroptosis) in the ovary in somatic (granulosa) cells.
* CHK1-dependent elimination (checkpoint-1): CHK1 works semi-redundantly with CHK2 to cull oocytes that carry unrepaired meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In Chk2-/- neonatal ovaries, CHK1 turns on after birth and continues the culling. Inhibiting CHK1 in vitro (see LY2603618) rescues oocyte number in Chk2-/- ovaries but also slows cyst breakdown and slows primordial follicle formation.
* Hippo-YAP/TAZ controls ovarian somatic proliferation and [ovary organ scaling](https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/43/6/1074/6590289?utm_source=chatgpt.com); granulosa YAP activity promotes growth, while LATS1/2 restrain it.
* [larger ovaries and follicles via growth hormone](https://ovarianresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1757-2215-5-18?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* [upregulate IGF-1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9219699/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) for size, also [IGF-1 increases ovulated oocyte number](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9219699/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* protect the ovary during adolescence and pre-puberty ("anti-burnout") via AMH and mTOR inhibitors and AS101 reduces "burnout" ([ref](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1620729114?utm_source=chatgpt.com)); consider low dose persistent AMH or mTOR inhibition (perhaps targeted to the ovary)
* physiologic fetal pruning needs to be aborted or mitigated somehow, possibly via S1P pathway agonism ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063448/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) or S1P pathway protection

some goals:

* increase fertility
* ovarian hypertrophy, larger ovaries
* more oocytes, more eggs, more primordial follicles, enhanced ovarian reserves, more activated follicles
* more oocyte survival during gestation and pre-pubertal culling
* better DNA DSB repair inside oocytes
* extra ovaries, supernumerary ovaries, access ovaries
* more mature oocytes even with some amount of DNA DSBs or other problems, to use the mature eggs for oocyte donation, ooplasm donation, or oocyte enucleation
* artificial twinning or genetic disposition to twinning
* enable further germline genetic engineering
* deliver young mitochondria to aging oocytes, or otherwise optimize mitochondria for 50+ years of support in a cell-cycle-arrested oocyte.
* minimize follicular atrophy, hypoxia, or oxidative stress

TODO:

* somehow cause a pool of mitotically-active oogonial stem cells to survive and persist throughout life (prevent meiotic entry, maintain pluripotency, suppress further differentiation cues, interfere with basement-membrane assembly to keep germ cell nests open and not compartmentalized by follicles, engineer somatic ovarian stroma to express GDNF (glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor) and CXCL12 (two niche factors that maintain spermatogonial stem cells in mammalian testes and are absent in the fetal ovary), impose epigenetic breaks on differentiation, inhibit histone-demethylase KDM4B, and then suppression of TAp63 isoforms or up-regulation of anti-apoptotic BCL2 in the OSC sub-lineage would let extra oogonia survive.)
* for very long lived oocytes, consider amphibian or xenopus oocyte DNA DSB or DDR detection and repair genes and mutations
* could we convert spermatogonial sperm cells into mitotically-active oogonial stem cells to produce oocytes instead of sperm? what about the female imprint pattern?
* oocyte-specific deletion of Petn to cause premature follicular activation
* disable Hippo to allow for multiple oocyte activation
* look closer at Hippo in the context of ovarian fragmentation techniques
* FSH overexpression to increase fertility
* disable AMH to increase fertility
* <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2861">FOXO3 overexpression for enhanced ovarian reserves</a>
* enable or increase human postnatal oogenesis (a controversial subject in fertility science)
* speculation that [PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) may be related to a larger ovarian follicle pool?](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2655633/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* TODO: consider antibody targets for any of the above, including folliculogenesis, oocyte differentiation, maturation, AMH, follicular atresia, etc.
* TODO: what causes the pre-pubertal drop in follice count or oocyte pool?
* consider GFP expression in oocytes to assist with finding oocytes during future medical procedures
* cortical stroma is largely avascular and has no direct blood supply: arteries penetrate the hilus, branch in the medulla, and then form a fine network that stops at the cortico-medullal border. from there, oxygen, nutrients and drugs must diffuse through the cortical stroma to reach primordial follicles. large animals (sow, cow, ewe) have a thick cortex; the inner third is therefore the most hypoxic and most dependent on follicle-derived VEGF for local neovascularization. cortical stroma itself remains virtually capillary-free until follicles are recruited and secrete angiogenic factors.
* dolphin ovary cortical stroma is very thick. significant hypoxia adaptation. Lactate dehydrogenase isoforms are shifted to the anaerobic LDH-5 form, indicating metabolic reliance on glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation. Antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, catalase, GPx) in dolphin cortical stroma are low and comparable to values measured in cow, and they decline with age, so the same ROS vulnerability exists.
* PCOS may alter stromal vascularity or vascularization.

far out there:

* fetal ovarian donation either from clones or an aborted child
* [[extra ovaries]]

The embryonic genital tubercle is the shared primordium of penis/clitoris. Sonic hedgehog SHH from urethral epithelium maintains a proliferative mesenchymal progenitor pool; loss shrinks the organ by ~75% via lengthened cell cycle. WNT5A also drives outgrowth and urethral tubulogenesis. HOXA13/HOXD13 dosage is essential for genital tubercle formation. Androgen signaling (androgen receptor signaling via SRD5A2-mediated DHT) masculinizes the genital tubercle. Androgen receptor loss (Tfm) (such as [AR knockout](https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/30/2/119/2355048?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) yields female-typical external genitalia. In mouse, SRD5A2 loss can be partly buffered by testosterone. Androgen biosynthesis plays some role in addition to androgen receptors.

mouse - [Delineating a conserved genetic casette promoting outgrowth of body appendages](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003231). Note that the genital tubercle is larger in the AER-R26Fgf8-GOF (gain of function) embryos which also show excessive limb development. There is also in one figure a postaxial extra digit in the forelimb. "To compare the function of FGF8 in the limb and GT, we mated the R26Fgf8 allele with a transgenic Msx2-Cre line [35], which confers Cre expression in the forming and mature AER and the ventral limb ectoderm. As expected, the AER-R26Fgf8-GOF mutants exhibited excessive limb growth and developed extra digits (asterisk in Figure 3J), an enlarged calcaneus bone (arrowhead in Figure 3K), and ectopic skeletal elements (arrows in Figure 3J–3K, and Figure S4G) in both forelimbs and hindlimbs. These overgrowth phenotypes are similar but more severe than what has been observed in the [AER-Fgf4-GOF embryos](https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/133/1/33/43192/Increasing-Fgf4-expression-in-the-mouse-limb-bud), and further support the concept that FGF8 plays a pivotal role in promoting the outgrowth of both appendages."

# Muscle

## Muscle hypertrophy

Muscle hypertrophy can be achieved through myostatin inhibition or knockout of myostatin.

There are a number of options here, but with germline modification, a muscle-specific knockout of ACVR2B or myostatin are good choices.

Also follistatin overexpression in muscle.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myostatin-related_muscle_hypertrophy">myostatin</a> and follistatin and muscle hypertrophy, downregulation of activin type II receptor (ActRIIA/B) (targeted by bimagrumab).

## Muscle hyperplasia

As an alternative to muscle hypertrophy, you could instead increase muscle cell progenitors and increase the number of myocytes in the limbs or certain muscle groups (muscular hyperplasia).

TEAD1 (Hippo pathway effector complex partner): [myofiber-specific TEAD1 overexpression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5059137/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) drives a dramatic satellite-cell hyperplasia (many more Pax7+ cells) without increasing muscle size at baseline. This primes tissue for larger regenerative output because there are more myoblasts available to form new fibers.

Fn14 Tnfrsf12a (TWEAK receptor) in satellite cells increases satellite cell proliferation/self-renewal during injury.

[beta-catenin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3479319/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) activity is critical for determining myofiber number during myogenesis in embryogenesis.

Tcf4+ fibroblasts / PDGFRα+ FAPs regulate myogenesis and can bias fiber formation during development and regeneration. ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3005608/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## Muscle strength

[muscle-targeted IGF-1 overexpression](https://skeletalmusclejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2044-5040-1-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (various promoters: mIGF-1, α-actin, MCK) increases postnatal muscle mass and strength; multiple lines report larger fibers and higher tetanic force, and protection from age-related weakness. Mechanistically linked to AKT/mTOR.

FOXO family (muscle catabolism gatekeepers): [FoxO1/3/4 triple knockout](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9891940/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) mice maintain or increase strength into aging by suppressing atrophy programs (UPS/autophagy genes). Earlier work shows FoxO loss protects from muscle loss.

[inducible/conditional muscle AKT1 activation causes fiber hypertrophy and higher strength](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131%2807%2900338-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com), especially in fast glycolytic fibers. myr-AKT1 models show increased grip/peak force and IIb fiber growth.

enhancing ACTN3 (α-actinin-3 "power gene") function or maintaining fast-fiber identity is pro-strength.

[conditional Ctnnb1 (beta-catenin)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2675868/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) studies show it's critical for fetal myogenic progenitor number and eventual myofiber output, which will secondarily set attainable strength.

## Muscle metabolism

PEPCK-C overexpression: In muscle, this allows greatly improved metabolism and endurance (see "mighty mice"). Synergistic effect with myostatin inhibition is untested.

## Sprinting vs endurance

When they were in the process of cooling, these people were able to maintain their body temperature in a more energy-efficient way. People who lack α-aktinin-3 rarely succeed in sports requiring strength and explosiveness, while a tendency towards greater capacity has been observed in these people in endurance sports.")

# Theoretical "heterozygote advantages" genes

The principle here is that diseases such as sickle cell or Tay-Sachs, among many others, persist in a population because having one 'good' and one 'bad' copy of the gene offers a significant advantage - in disease resistance, intelligence, etc.

While it would be nice to find a point mutation that would mimic the benefits of heterozygosity, the most straightforward option would be to give someone both variants of the gene, with ~50% expression of each.

[Efficient introduction of specific homozygous and heterozygous mutations using CRISPR/Cas9](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17664) -- there is at least one other technique for doing this, perhaps the other one wasn't co-authored by the ex-president of stanford (an independent panel found "manipulation and/or grossly inadequate data handling"? in other research).

Using heterozygous alleles is useful because we know several exact effects of +/- gene dosage, whereas it would take possibly substantial trial-and-error to figure out the exact expression profile to replicate via synthetic gene circuit for expression of that same gene. It's not necessarily "50% expression" merely because the effect is caused by heterozygosity..

It could be possible to program germline genomic programs that cause heterozygotic allele dosage depending on cell type or [[cell-specific expression]] throughout development or post-birth gene expression, instead of whole-body heterozygotic allele. So some cells or tissues or organs in the body can be homozygous for the allele while other cells can have different gene dosage and therefore different expression. In general it is probably better to have whole-body heterozyous programming for an allele because you can do upfront sequencing and quality control on the genome before making a fetus, whereas chromosome editing during development (or later in life) will have more moving parts that need to be more carefully quality controlled upfront.

While this document is mainly about germline genetic engineering for whole-body genetic modification, it would also be interesting to consider any beneficial impact from heterozygotic allele gene editing in different cell populations in the adult via adult gene therapy or cell therapy.

TODO: vitamin D linked heterozygotic advantage mutation that allows for escape from accelerated clearance. Causes lower risk of severe respiratory infections and better pregnancy outcomes at high latitude. GC1F/GC1S.

# George Church's human genetic engineering wish list

[George Church's human genetic engineering wish list](https://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/protect.html)


Multigenic traits can have single gene variants -- often rare in populations, (or synthetic alleles absent in nature) with large impacts. Synthetic gene circuits can also provide a monogenic effect.

>Genotype: -/- means double-null for the gene (from both mother and father).  +/- means one copy ok (+)  and one broken (-) is sufficient to have a positive impact.  The rest require very specific sequences to see the positive effect. For example E6V means that at position 6 an "E" (Glutamate amino acid codon GAG) is mutated into a "V" (Valine codon GTG).

### geochurch space genetics

**Space genetics**: What if we cure aging and eliminate poverty and diseases of developing nations? We're going to have overpopulation, or at least some people say that. I don't think it's a great solution to say well we're not going to cure diseases of poverty or aging of the industrialized nation. One possibility is <a href="http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/spacex/elon-musk-making-humans-a-multiplanetary-species/">going to space</a>. I don't mean this frivolously. It's a good idea for our species because we're at risk from supervolcanoes and asteroids. In space, we have a new set of problems including radiation and low gravity even on Mars. And then there's space genetics issues. We have a consortium on this and space colony challenges.

We have challenges like gravity, osteoporosis, neuro-behavioral issues, microbiome issues.

Kind of a quirky list here. These are rare protective alleles. They are things that make your bones extra strong which could result in something that could help in space, or on earth. Some that reduce pain sensitivity, which you might want to turn on and off, because if you have it off all the time then maybe you end up hurting yourself like kids chewing on their tongues. ABCC11 will give you low odor which might be helpful in space travel contexts. The good version is common in Asian populations.

There are some things that have been tested in animals, like low cancer and high cognitive ability.

What about radiation resistance? Here's a case in the literature where radiation resistance was improved 100,000-fold. 10-fold using e14-deletion. 50-fold using recA. 20-fold using yfjK. And 10-fold using dnaB. See Ecoli, Byrne et al, eLife 2014 ("<a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/3/e01322">Evolution of extreme resistance to ionizing radiation via genetic adaptation of DNA repair</a>"). This only requires 4 mutations. There is a wide variation in natural organisms, but the only difference here is those 4 mutations.

<a name="regeneration" />
# Regeneration

Make a general embryological platform for regeneration. Salamanders achieve this through dedifferentiation but perhaps for human we can achieve this via in vivo maintenance of primordial pluripotent stem cells throughout adult life. There might be other ways to achieve this goal around healing.

[Lack of p21 expression links cell cycle control and appendage regeneration in mice](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1000830107?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

TODO: maintain primordial pluripotent stem cell pools throughout adult life.

TODO: look at salamander cell dedifferentiation capabilities, can we import that into human cells as a switchable capability?

# TODO

Tetracycline response elements, i.e. tet-on and tet-off, can be used for transgenes where constant expression is undesirable. While a number of options for such inducible expression exist, the tet system is the most studied. It is left as an exercise to the reader to determine which genes would be suitable candidates [I will add some when I get around to it (editor's note: 13 years later....)].

These latter ones show generally only little copy number variation (Table 1). However, we note that the direction of the correlation is different between rodents and humans. In humans, the relatively higher anxiety group has the smaller number of copies, while it is the other way around in the three tested rodent species (see above)." -- regulation of behavioral variance using snoRNAs.

Note also that thee are human-specific deletions compared to chimpanzees in otherwise conserved sequences. "A study examining intragenic clustering of human accelerated elements found that the transcription factor neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3 (NPAS3) has the largest population of noncoding-accelerated regions. NPAS3 is active during mammalian brain development and the human accelerated elements within this locus predominantly appear to act as transcriptional enhancers."

* find areas of "accelerated evolution" in recent human genome; look at common mutations in the population; most mutations are probably detrimental or neutral. It's possible to figure out which genes (and alleles in particular) have been spreading rapidly throughout the population, so we should look at that information.

* disable germline transmission of certain modifications (germline editing is primarily required for zero mosaicism by modifying pre-conception or post-conception a single cell embryo, but this is only a delivery detail not something specifically related to desiring inheritance; long-term inheritance is a secondary goal that could be toggled on and off)

* if you can cause ancephalic human fetal development via embryo engineering (such as for human cloning), then i wonder if you could introduce an engineered non-ancephalic neural cell line into the embryo (hybrid, mosaic or chimeric embryo) and have it develop the cortical neural tissues instead of the ancephalic cell line. this reduces concerns of non-brain pleitropy. The metabolic and other biological requirements in neurons is likely to be vastly different from the demands of the other cell types in the body; an increase in separation of concerns can reduce undesirable or unintended side effects including non-genomic other-tissue/other-organ "off-target effects".

* anti-sunburn, sunburn protection- see SOD pathway upregulation. additional radiation damage resistance or repair too.

* reduce human skin attractiveness to mosquitos, possibly related to carboxylic acid secretions

* optimize metabolism and nutrition for modern dietary demands

* TODO: incorporate things about neochromosomes and human artificial chromosomes (HACs) from the IRC logs. sc2.0 had a neochromosome to store all their tRNA synthetases. you can knock out an essential gene on a natural chromosome and put it on the artificial one so the neochromosome doesn't get lost over time.

* TODO: make a generic embryological platform for [[cell-specific expression]] and cell life cycle control during embryological development to target specific progenitor cell types or proliferators to increase their abundance, or otherwise regulate their proliferation or upregulate/downregulate, such that we can modularly plugin or swap out which cells we are targeting, based on cell lifecycle, rather than having to focus on unique genes related to those specific tissues or organs. Or will we have to edit specific to each tissue type due to quorum sensing and other growth limiting factors? <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674(00)81237-4">Loss of CDK inhibitor p27Kip1</a> globally increases organ size and causes multiorgan hyperplasia.

* TODO: larger neurons on surface of brain for interface with brain-computer interfaces? are there any other genetic changes to facilitate interfacing with long-term electrode implants? or the vascular electrode (stentrode?) scheme? optogenetic control of neurons proximal to the surface of the neocortex or other brain cortex surfaces? what about inside grooves, gyri or sulcri?

* improved gyrification, sulcri, encephalization things

* appearance, face genetics, symmetry, which parent does the child look like, etc

* resistance to cryoprotectant toxicity for cryonics, cryovitrification, etc

* TODO: make a document or system for GWAS variants, or alleles, or other mutations, indels, chromosomal microdeletions, etc, for which variants to avoid when making a germline genetically engineered human. Simply eliminating non-consensus genome mutations will substantially improve health and longevity, as Bram Cohen likes to point out. There is also some additional value in intentionally avoiding known-harmful mutations or alterations.

* acromegaly-like targeted GH/IGF-1 receptor improvement in hands to increase hand size?

## Microbiome

* TODO: intracellular protein recorders inside gut microbiome to report on metabolism?

### dental caries vaccine

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caries_vaccine)

a genetically modified strain of Streptococcus mutans called BCS3-L1, is incapable of producing lactic acid, which dissolves tooth enamel, and aggressively replaces native flora. In laboratory tests, rats who were given BCS3-L1 were conferred with a lifetime of protection against S. mutans.
Dr. Jeffrey D. Hillman suggests that treatment with BCS3-L1 in humans could also provide a lifetime of protection, or, at worst, require occasional re-applications. He figures the treatment would be available in dentists' offices and "will probably cost less than $100.
