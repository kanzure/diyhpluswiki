"nootropics" are drugs that make you smart or smarter. It is not necessarily a drug. Nootropics are defined as substances or technologies that have neurotrophic or beneficial cognitive effect, whether it improves learning, memory, [[intelligence]], or other cognitive phenomena.

The problem with nootropics is that they are not particularly effective so far. Can we make better smart drugs? Nicotine, dextroamphetamine, and a few others have non-zero impact but the results are not yet congruent with fantasy.

Meanwhile, a "_recursive_ nootropic" would be a nootropic that someone could take and then they subsequently design an even more powerful nootropic that further increases human intelligence or performance. This might sound similar to Aubrey de Grey's "longevity escape velocity" except it's more like "intelligence escape velocity" or recursive self-improvement.

Other than small molecule supplements, [[cell therapy]], or even [[gene therapy|gene-therapy]], there may be [[surgical options for intelligence enhancement|neurosurgery]] that could be developed with concerted effort.

Intracortical or intracellular parasites should be developed for intelligence enhancement. This could be done through genetic engineering, rational design, machine learning, and directed evolution and selection via bacterial populations in mammalian brains after colonization in brain and psychometric testing for the test function. There were some notes about using neuronal intracellular parasites (like toxoplasmosis) from the [[hplusroadmap]] IRC logs back in 2017 or earlier if you want to go looking for that.
