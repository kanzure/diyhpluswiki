# L29Ah's top priority interventions

All the interventions already exist and researched well enough to ascertain their net positive for longevity. Both lifespan and healthspan improvements belong.

The list is ordered subjectively by the "bang per buck" ratio. I'm open for additions, but keep the conflict resolution authority until we can agree how can something like this be pushed forward cooperatively without losing much utility for me.

The list items should apply to at least 10% of humanity. An arbitrary cutoff percentage to avoid it becoming a collection of niche genetic-specific tricks.

<details><summary>skeleton</summary>
### Short intervention name

Long intervention description. Usually tells what specifically must be done, at what periodicity, intensity and so on, in a few sentences. ideally the description is enough to let people reproduce the intervention. All the following sections are optional, although "Why?" should always be filled.

<details><summary>Details</summary>
In case the intervention is too complicated, or otherwise has important notes, the exact details should go in this section.
</details>

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
Detailed description on why I think the intervention is effective and efficient, or at least a few links to the research.
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
A few words on where the intervention may not be appropriate. Notable controversies, including research, belong here as well.

### Not doing stupid shit

Consuming ethanol, smoking, injecting questionable substances, engaging in extreme sports, getting in street fights, going to war, going to prison, not treating serious diseases. All of this reduces life expectancy a lot and has to go somewhere, and this is the catch-all for those things you can just avoid without facing a noticeable impact on your "life quality", while not being blatantly obvious like jumping off the roof.

<details><summary>Details</summary>
Tobacco accounted for [18.1% of USA deaths in 2000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15010446/):
![Numbers of U.S. deaths from behavioral causes, 2000](https://professional.heart.org/en/-/media/PHD-Images/Science-News/Figures/Foundational-Factors-for-Cardiovascular-Disease/figure_1_foundational_factors_for_cardiovascular_disease.png)
</details>


### Avoiding carcinogens

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen) has a surprisingly decent list.

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
Third of USA mortality comes from cancers, and much more than a third in long-living athletes like racket sports players. Dietary carcinogens seem to have the largest impact, so focus on avoiding burnt/grilled/fried/smoked/nitrated/nitrited food.
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
It is hard to estimate how much cancer is caused by non-stupid-shit-grade carcinogens, possibly a small minority. Some commonly available things that are classified by IARC as probable human carcinogens don't seem to actually observably cause cancer in humans despite wide exposure (styrene, dichloromethane, low dose gamma rays).
</details>


### Eating the essential nutrients

I have [muesli](https://github.com/l29ah/muesli) devoted to this problem, although a bit outdated at this point. Not sure how to distinguish basic things like those 50-ish unquestionably-essential substances required by human metabolism and more niche yet still traditional and available things like caffeine and creatine, maybe they belong elsewhere.
TODO evaluate drinking


### High intensity decreasing interval training

Three times a week seems optimal.

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
[HIDIT is the most effective form of HIIT](https://hiitscience.com/perfect-workout-high-intensity-interval-duration/). HIIT is [the most effective form of cardio exercise](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10121111/). Cardiovascular fitness is one of the best predictors of longevity.
[Longevity correlation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3491006/). Seems to [help with cognition at old age](https://lifespan.io/news/exercise-improves-cognition-depending-on-type-and-amount/).
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
100 minutes a week could be spent elsewhere, can't really think much during sprints. Powerful hearts [are correlated](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/0115/p78.html) with deadly arrythmias (but [not readily](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circep.117.005598)). A lot longer moderate physical activity [may be a better option for longevity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10121111/).
</details>


### Significant others

The social safety net virtually anyone can afford and enjoy.

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
[Correlated to long-term survival, especially in males](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-5778/9/4/104). Who is going to save your life after you get incapacitated at home? Who is going to criticize you for your stupid lifestyle choices you don't even remember making? Who is going to accompany you during your exercise?
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
Could be a huge time/attention sink if inexperienced/done wrong.
</details>


### Avoiding atherosclerosis

Atherosclerosis is the single most deadly disease, directly claiming about a third of lives in USA and impairing lots of others. Most of the avoidance boils down to smarter eating and getting your energy intake in sync with your energy expenditure.

<details><summary>Details</summary>
[Prevention approach](https://myticker.com/).
[Trans fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat) should go.
</details>


### Avoiding type 2 diabetes

[Metabolic syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome) also belongs here. Maybe should be merged with atherosclerosis? Probably eating too much bioavailable carbohydrates too quickly is not only overloading lipid-handling mechanisms but also other things.

<details><summary>Details</summary>
[Strength training could help](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50807008_Strength_Training_as_a_Countermeasure_to_Aging_Muscle_and_Chronic_Disease).
</details>


### Skin checks

[Looking for skin abnormalities](https://www.cancer.org.au/cancer-information/causes-and-prevention/sun-safety/check-for-signs-of-skin-cancer) every 1-12 months(?), refer to dermatologist on detection. Essential for early [skin cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_cancer) detection.

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
[White skinned people have 2.5% lifetime risk of melanoma](https://www.curemelanoma.org/about-melanoma/people-of-color).
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
10 minutes a year could be spent elsewhere?
</details>


### Blood pressure monitoring

Once a month-year (depending on history).

<details><summary>Details</summary>
Mind the [proper](https://www.heart.org/-/media/Images/News/Infographics-and-Charts/TakingHBPFINAL_sized.jpg) [technique](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2023/11/09/where-and-how-you-sit-matters-when-getting-blood-pressure-taken-at-the-doctors-office).
</details>

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
[Hypertension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension) is a symptom and a cause of multiple deadly diseases, that is often unnoticed and cheaply adjustable.
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
10 minutes a month could be spent elsewhere? Also saving $15 on a sphygmomanometer/an automated blood pressure meter.
</details>


### Healthy sleep

Usually boils down to following [sleep hygiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_hygiene), although things like melatonin and modafinil can be useful in some cases.

<details><summary>Details</summary>
[In-depth overview](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life).
</details>

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
Severe sleep deprivation kills quickly. Sleep deprivation results in worse brain maintenance, [myelin loss](https://lifespan.io/news/sleep-deprivation-affects-cognition-via-myelin-loss/), long-term learning disruption and more.
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
Sleep is the single largest time sink. Synchronizing your rhythms to your social needs might get tricky or impossible.
</details>


### Ultraviolet light avoidance

Other sorts ionizing radiation should be avoided too.

<details><summary>Details</summary>
Sunscreens aren't very effective, clothing should be preferred in general.
</details>

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
UV light is a major source of skin cancers and skin aging due to mutagenesis, much more dangerous for white-skinned people. Vitamin D can be acquired elsewhere for cheap.
</details>


### Strength training

To avoid converting minor coordination mistakes into fatal accidents, and more.

<details><summary>Details</summary>
Two-three times a week should be good. For simple equpment/equipment-free exercise, see [Convict Conditioning](https://archive.org/details/ConvictConditioning-HowToBustFreeOfAllWeaknessUsingTheLostSecretsOfSupremeSurvival_201711/C-Mass-%20Paul%20Wade/) but beware bro-science.

The lack of adequate equipment [could be countered with repeated movement](https://lifespan.io/news/weight-training-load-doesnt-affect-muscle-mass-or-strength/) up to a point.
</details>

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
[Sarcopenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcopenia) is going to get you, especially if you're getting low on androgens. Your height is enough to knock you out or even kill you if you crash your head against hard things. Training the most important muscle groups will [give you more control over your position and speed related to hard things](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8304136/).

Strength training [can counter some other aging factors](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50807008_Strength_Training_as_a_Countermeasure_to_Aging_Muscle_and_Chronic_Disease).

Varied exercise improves immune system functioning via lots of mechanisms, but the magnitude of the changes is unclear.
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
100 minutes a week could be spent elsewhere. Exercise beyond basics (squats and pushups (the most important muscles to move you around), situps, crunches, bridges) need equipment. Poor form may result in injury. Continuous long-term training brings diminishing returns.
</details>


### Beating papillomavirus

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
Reduced cancer risks, especially in women. Intact mucuous membranes.
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
Nonavalent vaccine is $100. Universal treatment doesn't exist.
</details>


### Beating herpesviridae

#### HSV

You're probably infected, and it is probably incurable, but can be beaten into submission. [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae#Human_herpesvirus_types). Valaciclovir seems like a decent maintenance option.

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
Having your neurons and immune cells intact helps a lot.

#### CMV

Linked to inflammaging, immunosenescence and atherosclerosis. Extremely taxing on immune system.

#### EBV

Responsible for virtually all multiple sclerosis (30x relative risk), although MS appears only among 0.032% ppl.

#### HSV

Beating it will maybe save you [about 7 IQ points on average](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5648626/) and [eliminate most of dementia risk at old age](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5935641/).

#### VZV

[Some scientists claim it reduced dementia risk by 20% in Wales](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x.pdf). Or probably [delays dementia somewhat](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03201-5). Or maybe [just reduces incidence by 2±2%](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00455-7/fulltext) (HR=0.9964).

Vaccination [helps against cardiovascular events (HR=0.77)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40324473/).
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>

#### CMV

There's no vaccine in 2026. Ganciclovir helps but doesn't eliminate the virus and has serious side effects, drugs that deal with ganciclovir-resistant CMV are even more toxic.

#### EBV

There's no vaccine or treatment in 2026.

#### HSV

There's no vaccine in 2026. Valaciclovir has [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valaciclovir#Adverse_effects) (although these are likely evaluated mostly among old ill people, since latent HSV isn't considered actionable by most medical systems in the world) and resistance is an issue. Replacement drugs are more toxic.

#### VZV

The vaccine may be hard to get. The welsh study looks like cherry picking to me:

</details>


### Metformin

500 mg twice a day should do it.

<details><summary>Details</summary>
Splitting the daily dose or using slow-release formulations help with GI discomfort.
</details>

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
[Effect estimation](https://gwern.net/longevity#benefit-1). Lots of [optimistic research](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2017/4/metformin-slashes-cancer-risks).
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
Messes up inflammation. Taking metformin as T2D treatment [has worse prognosis than not having T2D](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-pdf/51/6/1886/47882534/dyac200.pdf), unlike [previously believed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25041462/).
</details>


### Thymus rejuvenation

So far the [HGH + DHEA + metformin protocol](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6826138/) seems to be researched the best (and there are going to be more trials, notably [TRIIM-X](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04375657) is near completion).

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
Most of deadly old age diseases rely on reduced immune system capacity to proceed at accelerated pace, [thymus involution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymic_involution) is one of the mechanisms responsible for adaptive immunity incapacitation. Centenarians have [enhanced](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10711357/) [immune](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1907883116) [system](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964%2825%2900366-4/fulltext) functioning. Not having a working thymus [kills](https://www.hsci.harvard.edu/news/turns-out-lowly-thymus-may-be-saving-your-life).
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
Growth hormone is often hard to source and requires daily injections. Growth hormone secretagogues are more available but aren't a direct replacement and have little research, no trials for thymus rejuvenation specifically. Although there may be [other options to stimulate GH secretion](https://newlifelongevity.com/anti-aging-resetting-our-epigenetic-clocks-my-version-of-the-horvath-clock-cocktail/), the impact is questionable.

There's no long term research on humans of any sort of thymus rejuvenation.
</details>


### Calorie restriction

Often achieved via [intermittent fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting). Rapamycin probably also belongs here.

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
Triggers autophagy via mTOR inhibition. Helps with fat control. Has plenty of [optimistic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08026-3) research on animals. Improves [some aging biomarkers](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/calorie-restriction-slows-pace-aging-healthy-adults).
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
May be annoying. No long-term research on humans. Confounded by body fat reduction effects: as of 2026, no studies had body fat-matched controls or tried to account for body fat effects.
</details>


### Plasma dilution

Also known as "[[plasmapheresis|longevity/plasmapheresis]]" and "therapeutic plasma exchange" for more specific conditions.

<details><summary>Details</summary>
Replacing half of blood plasma with saline and albumin. Perhaps albumin could be forgone at lower replacement volumes.
</details>

<details><summary>Why?</summary>
[Shaves off some aging biomarkers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-022-00645-w) by dumping junk accumulated in the blood plasma.
</details>

<details><summary>Why not?</summary>
Unobtainum. Unclear whether it translates to actual lifespan gains.
</details>
