# Anti-Aging Interventions

This page is just a list of interesting or underexplored potential therapies for the terminal disease we all suffer from.

- [inhibition of IL-11 significantly reduces age-related cancers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39020175/)
  - Inhibition of IL-11 increased lifespan in both male and female mice. The magnitude of lifespan extension remains to be fully determined but current data suggest that anti-IL-11 therapy given in late life increases median lifespan by more than 20% in both sexes. In these experiments, anti-IL-11 was injected in mice from 75 weeks of age (human equivalent to approximately 55 years of age) and it remains to be seen whether administration to older mice has similar effects and/or if short term anti-IL-11 therapy is effective for lifespan extension, as seen for rapamycin. Mouse mortality in old age is often cancer-related44 and our end-of-life autopsy data support the notion that inhibition of IL-11 significantly reduces age-related cancers. Of note, IL-11 is important for tumorigenesis and tumour immune evasion and clinical trials of anti-IL-11 in combination with immunotherapy to treat cancer are planned22.
