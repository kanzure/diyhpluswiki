## About

The diyhpluswiki is a collaborative wiki for open source hardware, do-it-yourself biohacking, and practical human enhancement engineering projects. It covers topics such as genetic engineering, gene therapy, longevity, intelligence enhancement, molecular nanotechnology, brain uploading, cryonics, and other transhumanist technology development. The wiki is maintained by the [hplusroadmap](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/hplusroadmap/) community, an engineering group focused on turning near-future ideas into practical projects.
