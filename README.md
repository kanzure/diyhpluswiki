# Bitcoin Transcripts

We are in the process of transitioning from https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/ to bitcointranscripts.org (not currently hosted).

During this transitional period please keep opening pull requests to this repo.

You can follow Bitcoin Transcripts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/btctranscripts).

For more information on completing Bitcoin transcripts see this [Bitcoin Magazine article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-want-to-learn-about-bitcoin-try-contributing-a-transcript).

When bitcointranscripts.org is up all existing and future Bitcoin transcripts will be hosted there and https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/ will redirect to it.

We will accept any transcripts that may be of interest to the Bitcoin technical community. These can be transcripts from recent events or historic events.

To save yourself time please ensure you don't complete a transcript that already exists! You can provide edits to existing transcripts if they are missing content or contain inaccuracies by submitting a PR.

Existing transcripts are generally organized by event directories. Feel free to get in touch with michaelfolkson at gmail dot com with any questions.
