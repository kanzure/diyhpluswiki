Here are some papers where **light/optogenetics steers axon (and some dendrite) growth** either by locally photoactivating intracellular guidance machinery or by making guidance receptors light-switchable.

# Non-optogenetic axon wiring techniques

Optogenetics is not the only way to determine axon guidance. Protein patterning and 3d printing can provide direct guidance for axon growth. In addition, physical manipulation is another option using AFM probe tips.

[Mechanical manipulation of neurons to control axonal development](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4719026/) -- "We show that AFM probe tip with microbeads adhesively contacted onto an axon or dendrite can be pulled to initiate a new neurite that can be mechanically guided to form new synapses at up to 0.8 mm distance in <1 hour. The extension rates achieved are faster than 20 μm/min over millimeter-scale distances and functional connections are established. ur proposed mechanical approach bypasses slow chemical strategies and enables controlled connection to a specific target. We have yet to discover whether there is a fundamental upper limit to these speeds." They should have also tested using an AFM probe tip to dissect, prune or disconnect the neural network.

microfluidics and micro-channels can also constrain the growth direction of certain axons, using geometry and spatial confinement. See 2025-08-28 in the IRC logs..
