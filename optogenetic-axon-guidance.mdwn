Here are some papers where **light/optogenetics steers axon (and some dendrite) growth**—either by locally photoactivating intracellular guidance machinery or by making guidance receptors light-switchable.

**Axon guidance by subcellular Rac1 photoactivation (in vivo)**

* **Harris et al., 2020, Dev Cell** — Express **PA-Rac1** in zebrafish motor neurons; tight blue-light ROIs at the growth cone **turn axons on command**, even across normally repulsive somite boundaries; rerouted axons form **functional synapses** and **rescue guidance defects**. ([PMC][1])
* **Harris et al., 2021 (protocol)** — Step-by-step **optogenetic axon guidance** in embryonic zebrafish using PA-Rac1; details on illumination patterns, timing, and expected turning. ([ScienceDirect][2])

**Light-switchable guidance receptors**

* **Endo et al., 2016, Sci Reports** — Engineered **photoactivatable DCC (netrin receptor)** via CRY2 clustering; pulsed blue light **attracts growth cones** (chick DRG) and **navigates axons in vivo** (C. elegans). ([Nature][3])
* **Tymanskyj et al., 2025, Mol Biol Cell** — Local optogenetic activation of receptor signaling **remodels growth cones** and redirects outgrowth; a general receptor-level handle for optical guidance. ([PMC][4])

**Optogenetic trophic signaling to bias neurite fate/trajectory**

* **Woo et al., 2019, Cell Chemical Biology** — **Opto-TrkB**: local TrkB activation at a neurite tip generates **actin waves**, creates a growth-cone–like domain, and **converts that neurite into the axon**, steering elongation. ([PMC][5])
* **Wang et al., 2020, eLife** — **optoRaf**/**optoAKT** pulses promote axon **regeneration** and allow **temporal tuning of regrowth direction** after injury. ([eLife][6])

**Foundational & how-to**

* **Wu et al., 2009, Nature** — Original **PA-Rac1** design (LOV-Rac1); reversible, subcellular activation that drives directed protrusion—basis for later neuronal guidance work. ([PubMed][7])
* **Harris et al., 2021 (review/how-to)** — Overview of **optogenetic axon guidance** concepts and implementation in embryos. ([PMC][8])

**Dendrite patterning with optogenetic perturbations**

* **Xu et al., 2024, Dev Cell (review with applications)** — **OptoTrap** of endogenous proteins in neurons reveals **microtubule/kinesin-1 roles in dendrite growth and branch patterning** with precise spatiotemporal control. ([PMC][9])
