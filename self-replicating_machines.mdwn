Self-replicating machines (SRMs), as developed in the work of Robert A. Freitas Jr. and the Kinesthetic Self-Replicating Machine (KSRM) lineage, are formally defined as physically embodied, autonomously controlled manufacturing systems capable of producing functionally equivalent copies of themselves from externally supplied raw materials by executing a closed, recursively complete construction set under finite resource constraints. In Freitas’ framework, SRMs are analyzed using von Neumann–style kinematic and logical decompositions, distinguishing between the universal constructor, instruction set, control automaton, and material handling subsystems, with rigorous attention to closure under replication, error rates, thermodynamic efficiency, and scalability across size regimes (from macroscale factory replicators to molecular nanofactories). KSRM implementations emphasize mechanical self-replication using modular parts, deterministic assembly sequences, and spatially localized interactions, demonstrating practical constraints such as tolerance accumulation, alignment error propagation, and exponential growth limits imposed by throughput bottlenecks. Across both traditions, key technical challenges include achieving full materials closure (eliminating externally fabricated components), minimizing informational overhead in the instruction genome, maintaining replication fidelity below the Eigen error threshold, and integrating sensing, actuation, and control architectures that allow robust replication in noisy physical environments without human intervention.

Some [[projects/proposals]] involving self-replicating machines include:

1) RepRap Grand Prize ( http://gadaprize.org/ ) is an open source competition that started at Foresight Institute to leverage competition between innovators to improve RepRap. It's an open source, freely-downloadable 3D printer that aims to eventually make all of its own parts. It's spawned businesses like Makerbot Industries, MakerGear, and Aleph Objects. The interim prize ends December 31, 2012 and is fully funded at $20,000. The Grand Prize was announced in January 2010 and ends December 31, 2015 with a targetted prize pool of $80,000. Documentation and rules & terms available on request.

9) SKDB ( http://gnusha.org/skdb ) is a set of standards for open source hardware to make it possible to download hardware over the web. By interfacing with CNC machines, RepRaps and 3D printers, a computer can write instructions specific to an end-user's inventory to make some target system (hypothetically, say an electric spaceplane, or a smartphone). Funding is sought to pay for help to take open source hardware out on the web and put it into a standardized format in a common, public repository. $10,000.

11) Global Village Construction Set ( http://openfarmtech.org/ ). Marcin Jakubowski has been working on a virally replicable village construction set on a farm in Missouri, basically the infrastructure necessary for seasteading minus the parts about living on the sea. Marcin has a TED talk coming up later this year and is presently seeking $1.2M in funding. Documentation & videos available on request.
