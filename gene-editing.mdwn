* telomerase
* Cas9-recombinase fusion proteins
* DNA polymerase editors: this technology combines Cas9 nickases with DNA polymerases and tethering of a single-stranded DNA template, for example, using an HUH endonuclease. A key difference from prime editing lies in its use of DNA polymerase rather than reverse transcriptase and the delivery of the DNA template in trans
* CRISPR integrases: based on combining prime editors with site-specific serine recombinases
* Target-primed reverse transcription: this process involves fusing nickase Cas9 with non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposon-derived reverse transcriptases and RNAs. It operates by nicking the target DNA to generate a free 3′ end to prime reverse transcription of the retrotransposon-associated RNA, resulting in targeted DNA insertion.
* HEARO (HNH endonuclease-associated RNA and ORF) or OMEGA (obligate mobile element guided activity) nucleases, are encoded within prokaryotic transposable elements in which they contribute to the transposition mechanism and promote transposon retention

* CRISPR-associated transposons: these naturally occurring mobile genetic elements utilize CRISPR effector complexes in conjunction with transposase proteins for RNA-guided transposition to insert long DNA sequences into specific genomic sites
* retrotransposons and retroelements -- Like prime editors, retroelements catalyze DNA insertion by target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT), a mechanism that involves nicking the target DNA and using the exposed 3′ end of the nick to prime reverse transcription of the retrotransposon RNA.

more stuff:

* [Programmable epigenome editing by transient delivery of CRISPR epigenome editor ribonucleoproteins](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63167-x) to directly deliver proteins into cells instead of DNA or RNA encoding Cas9. The actual protein is physically smaller because of folding.

**Cytosine Base Editors (CBEs):**
- dCas9-APOBEC variants (general concept)
- BE3 (Base Editor 3) - dCas9-APOBEC1-UGI
- BE4max - improved CBE with enhanced efficiency
- eA3A-BE3 - enhanced cytosine base editor
- BE4max-SpRY - expanded PAM compatibility CBE

**AID/APOBEC-dCas9 fusions** are fusion proteins combining catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) with AID (Activation-Induced Deaminase) or APOBEC (Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Catalytic Polypeptide-like) enzymes to perform targeted cytosine-to-uracil editing. AID/APOBEC enzymes naturally deaminate cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA, and the dCas9-gRNA complex creates the necessary R-loop structure exposing single-stranded DNA for editing. These are the foundation of cytosine base editors (CBEs). The most common versions use APOBEC variants fused to dCas9, such as BE3, BE4max, and AID/APOBEC1-BE3. These systems successfully convert C-G to T-A base pairs at targeted locations. 

**Adenine Base Editors (ABEs):**
- dCas9-TadA variants (ecTadA-dcas9 in original paper)
- ABE7.10
- ABE8e - optimized adenine base editor
- miniABE - compact adenine base editor

**Prime Editors:**
- PE2, PE3 - successive prime editor improvements
- miniPE - compact prime editor
- ePE3 variants - enhanced prime editors

**dCas9-RT-pegRNA systems**: Prime editors could instead be based on dCas9-RT-pegRNA systems, but nickase is significantly more kinetically efficient. This would be deactivated dead Cas9 + reverse transcriptase + prime editing guide RNAs. But, just use nickase instead.


**Specialized Systems:**

[Programmable editing of a target base in genomic DNA without double-stranded DNA cleavage](http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC4873371/)

"Here we report the development of base editing, a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C→T (or G→A) substitution. The resulting “base editors” convert cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides (nt), and can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines, second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI), and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to favor desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent correction of ~15-75% of total cellular DNA with minimal (typically ≤ 1%) indel formation. Base editing expands the scope and efficiency of genome editing of point mutations."

[A programmable Cas9-serine recombinase fusion protein that operates on DNA sequences in mammalian cells](http://evolve.harvard.edu/123-RecCas9.pdf)

"We describe the development of 'recCas9', an RNAprogrammed small serine recombinase that functions in mammalian cells. We fused a catalytically inactive dCas9 to the catalytic domain of Gin recombinase using an optimized fusion architecture. The resulting recCas9 system recombines DNA sites containing a minimal recombinase core site flanked by guide RNA-specified sequences. We show that these recombinases can operate on DNA sites in mammalian cells identical to genomic loci naturally found in the human genome in a manner that is dependent on the guide RNA sequences.

"Tyrosine and serine recombinases such as Cre, Flp and C31 integrase have been widely used to catalyze the recombination of exogenous DNA into model organisms (18,19). However, the use of these enzymes has been limited by their intrinsic, non-programmable DNA sequence specificity. Most small serine recombinases, for example, recognize a specific pseudo-palindromic core DNA sequence of approximately 20 base pairs (20). Recombination using these enzymes at endogenous DNA sequences only occurs at 'pseudo-sites' that resemble the recombinase's natural DNA recognition sequence or at genomic sequences for which the recombinase has been experimentally evolved (19,21–26)."

"To increase the number of sites amenable for targeted recombination in cells, researchers have fused hyperactive variants of small serine recombinases to zinc finger and TALE DNA-binding proteins (27–31). Because the catalytic domain and DNA-binding domain are partially modular in some recombinases, replacement of the natural DNA-binding domains with zinc-finger or TALE repeat arrays can partially retarget these enzymes to specified DNA sequences. Although the guide RNA-programmed Cas9 nuclease has quickly grown in popularity due to its relatively unrestricted DNA binding requirements and its ease of use, a guide RNA-programmed recombinase has not been reported."

"Here, we describe the development of recCas9, a guide RNA-programmed small serine recombinase based on the fusion of an engineered Gin recombinase catalytic domain with a catalytically inactive Cas9. The recCas9 enzyme operates on a minimal pseudo-core recombinase site (NNNNAAASSWWSSTTTNNNN) flanked by two guide RNA-specified DNA sequences. Recombination mediated by recCas9 is dependent on both guide RNAs, resulting in orthogonality among different guide RNA:recCas9 complexes, and functions efficiently in cultured human cells on DNA sequences matching those found in the human genome. The recCas9 enzyme can also operate directly on the genome of cultured human cells, catalyzing a deletion between two recCas9 psuedosites located approximately 14 kb apart. This work represents a key step toward engineered enzymes that directly and cleanly catalyze gene insertion, deletion, inversion or chromosomal translocation with user-defined, single base-pair resolution in unmodified genomes."

"Our group and others recently demonstrated that the N-terminus of dCas9 could be fused to the FokI nuclease catalytic domain, resulting in a dimeric dCas9-FokI fusion that cleaved DNA sites flanked by two guide RNA-specified sequences (10,11). We used the same fusion orientation to connect dCas9 to Gin, a highly active catalytic domain of dimeric Gin invertase previously evolved by Barbas et al. (34). Gin promiscuously recombines several 20-bp core ‘gix’ sequences (34) related to the native core sequence CTGTAAACCGAGGTTTTGGA (41–43). We envisioned that the guide RNAs would localize a recCas9 dimer to a gix site flanked by two guide-RNA specified sequences, enabling the Gin domain to catalyze DNA recombination in a guide RNA-programmed manner (Figure 1D)."

"We varied parameters influencing the architecture of the recCas9 components, including the spacing between the core gix site and the guide RNA-binding site (from 0 to 7 bp), as well as linker length between the dCas9 and Gin moieties ((GGS)2, (GGS)5 or (GGS)8) (Figure 2A-F). Most fusion architectures resulted in no observable guide RNA-dependent EGFP expression (Figure 1C and D). However, one fusion construct containing a linker of eight GGS repeats and 3- to 6-base pair spacers resulted in approximately 1% recombination when a matched, but not mismatched, guide RNA was present (Figure 2E and F). Recombination activity was consistently higher when 5-6 base pairs separated the dCas9 binding sites from the core (Figure 2F). These results collectively reveal that specific fusion architectures between dCas9 and Gin can result in guide RNA-dependent recombination activity at spacer-flanked gix pseudo core sites in human cells. We refer to this 8xGGS linker fusion construct as ‘recCas9’."

"The findings reported here provide a foundation toward RMCE (recombinase-mediated casette exchange) on native genomic loci that would require two complete recCas9 target sites to be proximal to each other. The estimated 450 human genomic sites identified in silico for recCas9 might be expanded substantially by replacing the Gin recombinase catalytic domain with other natural or manmade small serine recombinases that recognize different core sequences; many of these related enzymes have also been directed to novel sites via fusion to zinc finger proteins (19,63). Moreover, recent work altering Cas9 PAM binding specificity and the recent discovery of numerous Cas9 orthologs raise the possibility of further expanding the number of potential recCas9 sites (64–67). Extending the approach developed here may eventually lead to tools capable of specific, seamless integration of exogenous DNA into the human genome. [...] . While we carried out extensive optimization of the chimeric recCas9 to improve its activity (Figure 2), we imagine that further improvements, e.g. by evolving the chimeric fusion or using a recombinase domain with a broader sequence tolerance, may increase the activity and substrate scope of recCas9-mediated genomic modification. [......] the existence of recombination 'hot spots' or 'cold spots' biases the chromosomal regions that participate in crossover events and thus, the amount of diversity that can be combined into progeny using unassisted breeding (69). [...] the capabilities of recCas9 may further contribute to breeding efforts using elite cultivars by allowing researchers to manipulate the location of crossover events during meiosis. RecCas9 or future variants, in principle, could enhance or decrease the rate of recombination at specified loci, without introducing foreign DNA into the plant genome, by catalyzing favorable translocation events or removing specific mutational 'hot spots' that result in unfavorable crossover events."

[Redesigning recombinase specificity for safe harbor sites in the human genome](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139123)

"... we set out to identify mutations that enable unrestricted recombination between minimal recombination sites."

"However, because of their strict recognition capabilities, recombinase-mediated genome engineering has been limited to cells that contain either pre-introduced target sites or rare pseudo-recombination sites [21]. To overcome this, numerous protein engineering strategies have been developed to alter recombinase specificity [22]. Yet despite several successes [23, 24], these approaches have routinely led to enzymes with relaxed recognition specificities [25, 26], stemming from the fact that many recombinases display an intricate and overlapping network of catalytic and DNA-binding interactions. In contrast to the SSRs described above, the resolvase/invertase family of serine recombinases [27] are modular in both structure and function, allowing the DNA-binding domains of these enzymes to be replaced without impairing catalytic function [28, 29] (Fig 1)."

"The presence of a recA-independent homologous recombination pathway in E. coli was reported more than 20 years ago[19,20,21], but has been neglected until recently, except for sporadic use in specific high throughput applications[22,23]. The pathway is mostly uncharacterised but is most efficient at recombining linear DNA fragments, likely acting through an annealing mechanism[20,24], although alternative mechanisms have been suggested[25,26]. Conveniently, the recA-independent pathway is responsible for the recombination of short overlapping sequences[19], whereas the recA system requires longer homologous DNA stretches (>150-300 bp)."

"IVA cloning exploits a recA-independent recombination pathway, which is emerging as a powerful tool in DNA manipulation. Initial reports of this bacterial pathway and its application to cloning were not rapidly adopted, possibly due to the simultaneous reporting of in vivo cloning using bacterial strains expressing phage recombinases[51], which are now widely used for genome engineering[52]. While the recA-independent pathway has recently been utilised as a cloning tool in AQUA cloning, the protocols involved for its use in vivo require multiple PCRs, gel extraction, mixing of DNA fragments and incubation prior to transformation[28,29,30]. [....] Performing separate PCR reactions may increase efficiency when assembling >5 DNA fragments, since longer homologous regions can be included that could cause primer annealing problems if mixed in a single tube [...] While IVA is advantageous for almost all cloning applications, multiple modification of very large plasmids, such as BACs, which cannot be PCR amplified, would require different a different approach."

# Terminology in genetic engineering

**hypomorph**: a mutant allele that produces a partially reduced level of gene activity or protein function relative to the normal wild‑type allele.

**hyperomorph**: a mutant allele that confers an enhanced or constitutively active level of gene expression or protein function compared with the normal wild‑type allele.

**gain-of-function**: a mutation that endows a gene or its protein product with increased, novel, or constitutive activity relative to the normal wild‑type allele.

**loss-of-function**: a mutant allele that diminishes or eliminates gene activity or protein function compared with the normal wild‑type allele.

**deleterious SNP**: a single‑nucleotide polymorphism that reduces or disrupts normal gene or protein function, resulting in a harmful phenotypic effect.

**knockout**: a genetic strategy that completely abolishes the activity of a specific gene, typically by deleting or disrupting its coding sequence.  

**conditional knockout**: a genetically engineered approach that inactivates a target gene only in defined tissues or at particular developmental stages, usually via inducible site‑specific recombination.

**knock‑in**: a precise genetic engineering strategy that inserts a defined sequence (e.g., a point mutation, epitope tag, or reporter) into the endogenous locus without disrupting overall gene structure.

**conditional knock‑in**: a knock‑in allele that can be activated or altered only in selected tissues or at chosen developmental times, typically by Cre‑mediated recombination of a “floxed” stop cassette or mutation.

**knockdown**: a technique that diminishes the expression level of a gene, often through RNA interference or antisense methods, without entirely eliminating its function.

**over‑expression**: introduction of an exogenous DNA construct (often under a strong, heterologous promoter) that drives ectopic or supraphysiological levels of the gene product throughout the organism or in a defined tissue.

**inducible expression (Tet‑On/Tet‑Off)**: a transgenic system in which gene expression is turned on (Tet‑On) or off (Tet‑Off) by administration or withdrawal of doxycycline, allowing temporal control of a gain‑of‑function allele.

**neomorphic**: a mutant allele that gives the gene product a new activity or property that is not exhibited by the wild‑type protein (e.g., a novel binding specificity).

**antimorph**: a mutant allele that antagonizes the wild‑type allele’s function, usually by forming non‑functional complexes; it is often synonymous with a dominant‑negative effect.

**dominant‑negative**: a mutant allele that encodes a protein capable of interfering with the activity of the wild‑type protein (or its partners), thereby suppressing normal function even in the presence of a functional copy.

**null allele**: a mutation that eliminates all detectable activity of the gene product (e.g., a premature stop codon or large deletion) and is functionally equivalent to a complete loss‑of‑function but may retain transcription of a non‑coding transcript.

**humanized allele**: an allele in which the coding sequence (or regulatory region) is replaced with the orthologous human sequence, allowing functional studies of human‑specific variants in an in‑vivo context.

**Cre‑dependent (lox‑STOP‑lox) allele**: a cassette inserted upstream of a gene of interest that blocks transcription until Cre recombinase excises the flanked STOP sequence, enabling spatially restricted activation of the downstream gene.

**CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) / repression (CRISPRi) allele**: a dCas9‑based system in which a catalytically dead Cas9 fused to transcriptional activators or repressors is guided to a promoter region to up‑ or down‑regulate endogenous gene expression without altering the DNA sequence.

**zinc‑finger activation allele**: a programmable zinc‑finger protein engineered with a transcriptional activation domain (e.g., VP64, VPR) that binds a native promoter region to up‑regulate endogenous gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. See also CRISPRa.

**CRISPR‑CORRECT**: a genome‑editing method to create predictable zygosity. ([ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17664))

**splice-modulating base-editing allele (CRISPR-SKIP / SPLICER)**: a precise genome-editing strategy in which base editors (without creating double-strand breaks) are targeted to splice donor or acceptor motifs to force predictable exon skipping or inclusion at the endogenous locus, effectively creating hypomorph, null, or isoform-specific alleles by rewiring splicing rather than disrupting the entire coding region (e.g., CRISPR-SKIP in Gapinske et al., 2018; SPLICER platform for optimized splice-site editing, 2024).

**cis-regulatory motif-edited allele (prime editing of TF binding sites)**: an allele generated by base or prime editing of a specific transcription factor recognition motif (such as a CArG box) within an endogenous promoter or enhancer, allowing tissue-specific up- or down-regulation of gene expression by changing only one or a few bases in non-coding DNA while leaving the coding sequence intact (e.g., Gao et al., 2021 editing a single CArG motif in the *Tspan2* promoter to abolish smooth-muscle expression).

**enhancer-targeted CRISPRi/CRISPRa allele**: a configuration in which a catalytically dead Cas9 fused to repressor (KRAB, KRAB–MeCP2) or activator (VP64, p300, VPR) domains is stably expressed, and guide RNAs are designed to bind distal enhancers—rather than the core promoter—so that the element’s activity and its long-range control of one or more genes can be selectively repressed or boosted in a cell-type-specific or inducible manner (e.g., Fulco et al., 2016 tiling non-coding regions; Li et al., 2020 enCRISPRi/enCRISPRa in vivo).

**dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 epigenetic repression allele**: a specialized CRISPRi configuration in which dCas9 is fused to both KRAB and MeCP2 to recruit heterochromatin and DNA-methylation machinery, producing stronger and more durable silencing of endogenous promoters or enhancers than KRAB alone, effectively modeling a stable loss-of-function or hypomorphic regulatory state without altering the underlying DNA sequence (e.g., Duke et al., 2020).

**synthetic intron-enhanced allele**: an engineered allele in which one or more well-designed introns are inserted into a transgene or endogenous locus to increase transcription, improve mRNA processing, and/or reduce epigenetic silencing, leveraging intron-mediated enhancement to achieve higher and more stable expression while preserving the native protein sequence (e.g., engineered introns in Cas9 expression cassettes as in Arana et al., 2025, and broader intron-mediated enhancement work summarized by Rose and colleagues).

**refactored regulatory locus / synthetic locus allele**: a heavily redesigned version of an endogenous genomic region in which large stretches of native non-coding DNA (transposons, repetitive elements, non-essential introns, and idiosyncratic regulatory clutter) are deleted, compacted, or replaced with standardized, well-characterized regulatory parts, yielding a “clean” locus that maintains near-wild-type gene expression and organismal fitness while being easier to analyze and re-engineer (e.g., Sc2.0 synthetic yeast chromosomes where retrotransposons and many introns were removed or rewritten with minimal impact on growth and global transcription).

**CRISPR saturation mutagenesis library (non-coding tile library)**: a densely spaced library of CRISPR guides (using nuclease, CRISPRi, or CRISPRa) that target essentially every position across a promoter, enhancer, or larger non-coding region, generating a spectrum of regulatory alleles whose functional impact on gene expression or fitness is read out in bulk or single-cell assays, thereby mapping which bases and sub-elements are necessary, sufficient, or redundant for regulatory activity (e.g., non-coding tiling screens around oncogenes and ENCODE-scale maps like those summarized by Yao et al., 2024).

**MPRA-validated regulatory variant library**: a collection of synthetic promoter or enhancer variants cloned into barcoded reporter constructs and assayed in parallel (massively parallel reporter assays, MPRAs), producing a quantitative landscape of sequence→activity relationships that can be linked back to specific endogenous elements, enabling the design of neomorphic, hypomorphic, or hypermorphic regulatory alleles with partially predictable expression outputs (e.g., large MPRA studies and reviews such as Moeckel et al., 2024 that benchmark enhancer and promoter sequence–function maps).

**PASTE-integrated knock-in allele**: a large-cargo knock-in allele created by PASTE (Programmable Addition via Site-specific Targeting Elements), in which a Cas9 nickase–reverse transcriptase–integrase fusion installs a targeting element and a serine integrase then docks DNA fragments up to tens of kilobases at the edited locus without relying on HDR. ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10257351/))

**CRISPR-associated transposase (CAST) insertion allele**: an allele generated by RNA-guided transposase systems (for example Cas12k–Tn7 complexes) that integrate multi-kilobase donor cassettes at defined genomic sites in a DSB-free, HDR-independent manner, expanding targeted knock-in to difficult-to-edit cells and in vivo contexts. ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6659118/))

**CRISPRoff/CRISPRon epigenetic memory allele**: an allele whose expression state is durably silenced or activated by dCas9 fusions that write or erase DNA methylation and repressive histone marks at promoters or enhancers, producing long-lived, mitotically heritable regulatory loss- or gain-of-function without changing the underlying DNA sequence. ([ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421003536))

**optogenetic control allele**: an engineered allele in which the protein of interest or a synthetic transcription factor is fused to light-responsive domains (such as CRY2/CIB1, LOV2, or iLID), so that illumination with specific wavelengths produces precise, reversible activation, clustering, or relocalization of the gene product in vivo. ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5877946/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**CRISPR-based gene drive allele**: a cassette that encodes both Cas9 (or another nuclease) and its guide RNA within a locus such that, during meiosis, the drive copies itself onto the homologous chromosome via HDR, biasing inheritance and enabling population-level spread of loss- or gain-of-function traits (e.g., vector control in mosquitoes). ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10742955/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**CRISPR lineage-recorder / evolving barcode allele**: a synthetic genomic cassette containing arrays of CRISPR target sites that are progressively edited during development or over time, accumulating unique mutation patterns that serve as heritable barcodes for high-resolution lineage tracing and fate-mapping when read out by sequencing. See [[lineage tracing]].

**Cas13-mediated RNA knockdown allele**: a configuration expressing an RNA-targeting Cas13 effector and guide RNAs so that specific transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms, are degraded without altering the genomic DNA, providing a programmable, often more specific alternative to RNAi-based knockdown. ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11110701/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Cas13-based RNA base-editing allele** (REPAIR/RESCUE and derivatives): an allele configured to express catalytically dead Cas13 fused to ADAR-family deaminases, together with appropriate guide RNAs, to install programmable A→I or C→U edits in target RNAs, enabling transient rescue or mimicry of coding mutations at the transcript level without permanent genomic change. ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5793859/))
