    #this document is meant to catalog all possible entries in the autogenix
    #.agx file format, version 0.0.1  THIS WILL CHANGE
    #i will turn this into an xml schema or DTD as soon as i figure out how
     
    #apkg, the autogenix package manager, in combination with astream, keeps
    #track of the user's current "installation" which is the sum of all their
    #posessions and skills. it is also used to test various 'pretend'
    #scenarios, either manually or using agimme.
    #packages and streams may not have the same names as units.
     
    #agimme, (in analogy to apt-get) will test various trees of package
    #combinations in order to try to satisfy the requested functionality
    #(quantity*efficiency*quality), while still staying within the specified
    #cost envelope (money*labor*skill*time*hazard). the user can specify a
    #vector along which to minimize costs. the concept of capital does not
    #exist in this scenario, since one can either buy or make any required
    #infrastructure as necessary.
     
    #if the current installation has the capability to produce the desired
    #functionality or package, agimme runs the source code for each package
    #in the tree. this might send commands to a rapid prototyper, produce
    #a web page with plans for the user to follow, or simply dump cad files
    #to stdout.
     
    #explanation of syntax:
    #section: item, {item}, [[package:capability]]
    #items in {} are instances of whole sections being included. this means
    #anything that can be specified in the other section can be specified.
    #a single item from another section can be included with {section:item},
    #but this is sloppy and is discouraged.
    #items in [[]]'s are capabilities of other packages being specified.
    #if you specify a package/capability, the other package is required for
    #the current mode.
    #for non-package (stream) requirements, the requirement is treated as a
    #unit. presumably each stream will have its own DTD/schema
     
    #mathematical operators <,>,=,*,/,^,- can be used when there is at least
    #one number or unit. capabilities and streams count as units.
    #multiple constraints are AND'ed together, unless separated by a comma or
    #logical operator
    #example (an unusual shucking machine that can use multiple power sources):
    # run-time: electricity 240V 3*phase >=35A*peak >5A*continuous |
    #   compressed-air "3/8-NPT-F" 90psi 5scfm, [[human:attention]] 0.2
    # provides: corn 0.5kg/corn-cob # this kinda sucks
    # teams-with: [[packaging]] >=5gal, conveyor123
     
    #example (a plug-in-hybrid car - dont you love my mixed units?)
    # package-name: pollywag-car
    # provides: electricity 144VDC <100A NEMA-1234, electricity 12V <100A,
    #   transportation peak 90mi/h 300kg 1m*length 0.5m*radius,
    #   storage 1m*length 0.5m*radius, temp +25C | -10C, [[computer]],
    #   transportation 50mile/(diesel gal) | electricity 0.1kWh/mi,
    #   electricity 10kWh/charge, diesel 6gal,
    # run-time: diesel | electricity 144VDC NEMA-1234 |
    #   electricity 240VAC*60Hz NEMA-4567 |
    #   electricity 120VAC*60Hz IEC-632  #gets cross-referenced
    #   road, human:attention 1*peak 0.3*continuous #road and human are packages
    # build-time: fiberglass 4oz*20m^2, epoxy 10ksi 3gal,
    #   steel-4340:tubing 20mm*radius 3mm*thick 100ft*length, #hmm
    #   Emotor-21, dieselengine-600, computer:embedded #etc.
    # recommends: road:paved
    # teams-with: solar-carport
    # storage: 3m*long 2m*wide 2m*high, temp >-15C <70C, 600kg
     
    #the idea is to specify as little as possible to enable unanticipated
    #combinations of packages and streams, but specify enough so that it's
    #guaranteed to work without hackery. the user can test various scenarios
    #by using apkg's ignore and pretend tools if they are so inclined.

    #things that arent really capabilites or requirements, they just "are"
    ===properties===
    #much of this can be got from MSDS databases and autogenerated
    hazard: #will limit what type of space the package can be used in
      env-impact, cleanliness, noise, moving-parts, {power}, [[MSDS]]
    cost: #normally only specified for bought'n components+materials
      purchase cost, environmental cost #TODO expand on this
    materials:
      {cost}, {transportation}, {hazard}, {storage}, fatigue,
      strength, elasticity, damping, chemical/wear resistance, surface-finish
    space:
      #space is a package that is really more like a stream. it must? be a package
      #because it provides a crude nesting/collision-detection unit test
      #for determining whether the requested object will fit in the space
      long, wide, high, radius, thick, volume #for more complex spaces ??
      lighting, humidity, temperature, acceleration
    #TODO how to describe if something must stay right-side up?
    time:
      #much like space, but for units of time
      cycles, time-units
    complexity:
      #this was supposed to gauge the amount of human effort required to
      #inventory something, for example a cube would be less complex than a
      #tangly spider-web. i might just use [[human:attention]]/cycle in
      #the storage section instead
      bits
     
     
    #each operating mode should have its own run-time section
    #typical simple packages will have one run-time, one build-time, and
    #one storage dependency
