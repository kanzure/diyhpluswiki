# What is hplusroadmap?

hplusroadmap is a collaborative community of engineers, scientists, and makers working to transform transhumanist concepts into practical projects and open-source technology, with a focus on biological enhancement, longevity, intelligence, nanotechnology, space colonization, and other emerging technologies.

The #hplusroadmap IRC channel is a technology development and engineering group that focuses on projects such as:

* do-it-yourself biology, [[genetic engineering]], [[gene therapy]], biohacking, [[synthetic biology]]
* human embryo genetic engineering (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612838/the-transhumanist-diy-designer-baby-funded-with-bitcoin/">ref</a>), human [[cloning]], non-human cloning, chimeras, hybrids, microchimerism, [[xenotransplantation]], [[in vitro fertilization]]
* [[artificial womb]], uterus (xeno)transplantation, ex vivo uterus, organ xenotransplantation
* [DNA synthesis](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/dna/synthesis/notes/) machine development
* brain emulation, [[human brain uploading|brain uploading]], computational neuroscience, neuroanatomy, neurosurgery
* [[nootropics]], smart drugs, intelligence enhancement, memory enhancement
* [[cryonics]], biobanking
* [[molecular nanotechnology|nanotech]]
* molecular biology, [[polymerase]], fusion proteins, [[directed evolution]], <a href="http://diyhpl.us/wiki/gene-editing">gene editing</a>
* [[protein engineering]], protein design, protein language models, protein diffusion, enzyme engineering
* [[nutrition]], bodybuilding

The hplusroadmap chat is an active community with daily, weekly and monthly participants working on technology development.

# Collaboration

We have a wide range of different projects, some that are open source technology engineering projects, and others that are private commercial ventures. We're open to collaboration in public on open source or other open projects and are always interested in meeting collaborators in the extended community.

# Project funding and opportunities

There's some funding available for hplusroadmap projects. Are you interested in making [[human clones|cloning]]? Do you want to work on [[molecular nanotechnology|nanotech]]? Bring us your projects and let's talk. If we're not the right fit for funding your human enhancement project, then we likely know someone else who would be a better match.

# History

The hplusroadmap IRC channel was started in 2008 to focus on a roadmap for transhumanist technology development, do-it-yourself biohacking and turning near-future ideas into practical engineering projects.

The channel was hosted on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) until 2021-05-19, when a hostile takeover of the network led us to move to [libera.chat](http://libera.chat).

hplusroadmap originally started as a mailing list in 2007. The chat group was founded and is primarily administered by [Bryan Bishop (kanzure)](https://heybryan.org/).

# Arc of history and S-N ratio

hplusroadmap has an unusually high signal-to-noise ratio. For example, [the hplusroadmap community was extremely early to bitcoin](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/776900184836046849) showing word of bitcoin in the hplusroadmap logs on January 10, 2009 just 2 days after Satoshi Nakamoto's second or third announcement of the creation of [[bitcoin]] on the p2pfoundation mailing list. Thanks are also owed to Eugen Leitl for the nudge at that time.

Certain participants choose to remain anonymous such as investors, university professors, entrepreneurs, programmers, and various hackers. For a while we were adjacent to, though not affiliated with, the Jiankui He genetically modified human births controversy; and at different times adjacent to the Human Genome Synthesis Project (GP-write), coordination around DNA synthesis screening, the bitcoin project, and other things I'm probably forgetting.

It is hard to describe what this thing is. There is a wide variety of highly unusual and unlikely content in the logs. The Internet has a sort of "weirding way" about it, dunno what else to say except that there's some level of intentional or at least indirectly intentioned illegibility here. There's also noise and spam from time to time but we try to not have that. Buyer beware.

# Naming of hplusroadmap

Why is the hplusroadmap engineering group called "hplusroadmap"? Originally there was a mailman-style public mailing list for discussion around a "Transhumanist Technical Roadmap" back in 2007 on [Bryan Bishop (kanzure)](https://heybryan.org/)'s previous wiki. The name "hplusroadmap" comes from "hplus" (h+) for "human plus" (which at one point was a term used to reference transhumanist projects) and "roadmap" for "roadmap".

# Rules

* no philosophy (violators that are bad at philosophy will be harshly judged)
