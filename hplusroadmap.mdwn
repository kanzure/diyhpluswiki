# Projects

There's some funding available for hplusroadmap projects.

# History

The hplusroadmap IRC channel was started in 2008 to focus on a roadmap for transhumanist technology development, do-it-yourself biohacking and turning near-future ideas into practical engineering projects.

The channel was hosted on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) until 2021-05-19, when a hostile takeover of the network led us to move to [libera.chat](http://libera.chat).

hplusroadmap originally started as a mailing list in 2007.

# Rules

* no philosophy (violators that are bad at philosophy will be harshly judged)
