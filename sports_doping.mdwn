# High dose beta-2 agonists

[Performance enhancing effects of inhaled medications](https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/10/4/462) (2025)

clenbuterol and salbutamol improves immediate verbal recall and delayed recall compared with placebo ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11380312/))

## Clenbuterol

increased skeletal muscle mass and protein content ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1861634/), [ref](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00472.2002), [ref](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/JP289023))

clen is used for cutting and fat loss too.

## Terbutaline

High-dose inhaled terbutaline:

* increased quadriceps strength and enhanced maximal sprint performance versus placebo ([ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25113095/))

## Formoterol

[No bronchodilation benefit](https://publications.ersnet.org/content/erjor/early/2023/01/05/23120541.00643-2022.full.pdf)

## Salbutamol

high-dose oral salbutamol protocols can raise quadriceps/hamstring strength by around 10–20% in some studies ([ref](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sms.14567))

## Salmeterol

Salmeterol is a long lasting beta-2 agonist (LABA).

Bronchodilation - improved oxygen delivery. Larger airway dilation. Reduced airway resistance even in healthy lungs. Slight increase in VO2max. Lower breathing effort. Improved endurance in sustained aerobic activity.

Skeletal muscle - improved protein synthesis, reduced protein breakdown, increase fast-twitch muscle fiber size, improved neural activation of muscle fibers. Measurable increases in strength and power. Modest improvements in sprint speed and explosive performance.

Fat loss and body composition changes - better lipolysis (fat breakdown), slight thermogenic effect. Reduction of fat mass. Improved power-to-weight ratio. Physique improvements.

Stimulant effects - increased alertness, reduced perceived exertion, elevated heart rate, elevated motivation. Short-term feel good or energizing mood. Greater training volume tolerance.


# Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs)

S23 - extremely high androgen receptor affinity, full agonist in muscle, high anabolic : androgenic selectivity, very long receptor residency, very strong suppression of endogenous hormones.

RAD-140 (Testolone) - very high androgen receptor affinity, no conversion to estrogen or DHT, cognitive effects. Favors muscle/bone tissue. It belongs to the class of aryl-propionamide–based selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs).

RAD-140 has structure: 2-chloro-4-{[(1R,2S)-1-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]amino}-3-methylbenzonitrile ([ref](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4018048))

YK-11 (not a true SARM but often treated like one) (a derivative of 19-norandrostenedione, and partial androgen receptor agonist; also upregulates follistatin, an inhibitor of myostatin)

Ostarine (MK-2866 / Enobosarm)
