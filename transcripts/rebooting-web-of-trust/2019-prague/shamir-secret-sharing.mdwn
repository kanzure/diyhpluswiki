Chris Howe make a damn good start of a C version of Shamir secret sharing. We need to take it another level. This could be another project that we could engage on. We also didn't finish the actual paper, as such. I'd like to get both of those things resolved.

SatoshiLabs is saying that as far as they are concerned SLIP 39 is done and they are not interested in feedback or changing it or adapting it, at the words level. They just don't want to touch it. It seems like they are shipping it or are they manufacturing it already. On the other hand, they are fine if our libraries and things are abstracting the secret sharing from the encoding that allows for more functionality. The other trick is that there is some kind of header that you can kind of do-- since there is a checksum, you can change the header and see if the checksum is valid. So you can have a hacky way of doing a version which would allow you to use the encoding for other things. With their software, it would just checksum out and the checksum would be invalid because they assume the header would be the same.

They are willing to come in for a day. We also want to work on a custom secure chip. They are interested in the RISC-V architecture and various discussions about what is the minimum viable bootstrap for a secure chip and those kinds of issues. They would like to come in for a day, we should decide what day we would like them to come in, for either of those topics. They are here in Prague too but not physically here. So that's awkward.

The HTC people are here right now; they have effectively forked the Trezor sourcecode base and they run the Trezor source code in the executable environment of the trust zone. So it's more secure than a Trezor, and Trezor might not like that. I don't think it's competition; I would love to figure out how to engage with the SatoshiLab folks. Their comment was that the roadmap is on their website and all of their github issues are too, so why can't we work with them on this?

Adding write-once to HTC's TEE might require hardware changes. A Java Card is available for HTC. All of your fast memory chips are Secure Java cards because that's how they do fast memory. They are very interested in stuff and very supportive and they have a budget.

A tradeoff documents for Shamir secret sharing, multisig, verifiable secret sharing, and others. I would prefer to write code.

You split out the key into shares for each individual. That's a 256 bit number. So you can interpret this as a private key. It wasn't originally a private key, but you can use it as one. That's a secret that the owner of the share has. So the integrator can get a signed statement about what it should be signing, signed by that share. This is separate from the partial signatures approach. The signature you get here is not usable for blockchain signatures. The device can see 3-of-4... it's a way to communicate the request. If you had partial signatures, you wouldn't need the integrator and you could do it yourself, but that would require Schnorr or Taproot or whatever. Partial signatures are already viable as long as you can use Schnorr signatures.

Our goal is to have a decision about what it is that we want to try to do for this week. I think there's a lot of alignment here for things past this week. Let's gauge that and talk about the bigger issues. We talked about SatoshiLabs. I met with them recently. It was an interesting discussion. As far as objectives for Rebooting Web of Trust, I would love to finish that paper we started after rwot8 on just the peirls and promise of Shamir secret sharing. Do you guys feel like you want to work on the C library this week?

For the C library-- the previous Shamir implementation that was in the github repo had a bunch of countermeasures for sidechannel attacks. What I wrote didn't use those at all. There's certainly something to be done bringing that way of doing the gf256 arithmetic into my implementation. We can do tests. Daan's library was the most solid I was able to find. Take your implementation as a basis, but implement it into Daan's library. Either way. I am also interested in python bindings. I'd like the C code to have python bindings that more or less mirror SatoshiLab's implementation so that I can get rid of their code.

Leohoven tends to take an adversarial approach to implementations. The students attack each other's code pretty hard. So by the time you get through their doctorate program, you've got a lot of adversaries that you have overcome.

So one thing we could do is python bindings and sidechannel resistance for a Shamir secret sharing library or integrating with Daan's library. Given the discussions with the SatoshiLabs people, they really don't want us to touch or change or adapt anything in the encoding aspect of SLIP 39. So how it takes the 512-byte secret and turns it into a 33 byte... So for the 256 bit, it's 33, for the 128 bit, it's 20. They don't want to change that. They have basically already put in orders for new hardware that supports this. They have committed to this path. They are open, though, to not blocking or being problematic about other layers getting built on this, like the stuff other than encoding into text. They are interested in supporting more features. Like sharing through the HTC secure network to the peers, they don't see what the words are, you can basically send them binary information instead. We should have a scheme for adding in the information that you want to store.

The format should include a memo field and also hashes of the other pieces so that you can be confident. They are arguing that you would only use this once every 5 years so it should be as short as possible. If you add more metadata, it's more information for the attacker. But I hate security by obscurity, so I would rather see it go in the other direction. We could use a varint for days since 1970 very easily. That would be 2 bytes for the birthday if you're worried about the space. You can store metadata outside the secret. So there could be another format, and the secret gets embedded in that other format. But that other format should still be specified.

The other thing that Daan's code does is that he assumed you might have a small, low entropy secret. He did something so that the entropy was spread... if you use Shamir secret sharing purely with low entropy secrets, it's more vulnerable. That's not required with a cryptographic key, because you already know it ought to be random to start off. I'm not sure which defensive programming assumption we want to take. We should have a more firm architecture between the encoding and the Shamir part and the pre-Shamir part of how do you choose your shares and some of the parameters. So if you have a short non-key secret, then you should generate a random key to encrypt that secret, keep the encrypted secret blob, and the Shamir shares of the key.

There is no upgradeability, by design, in any of the SLIP 39 stuff. They didn't want upgradeability. They said they would support any kind of binary standard for Shamir, which they are open to version information for that stuff. Their version byte says "SL" Satoshi Labs or something... so that makes it worse. It's also the initial vector for some other crypto stuff. They want you to check the checksum against the different IV values for different versions, but it's weird. Do we want to do a BIP instead, that isn't the Satoshi Labs one?

The SLIP 39 proposal has a lot of issues. The group stuff it has for specifying groups of thresholds isn't worth a lot. There's the 2 layer social key recovery thing. It's their way of doing it, which isn't what we specified at all. It lets you say-- do thresholding at a second layer, so it's k-of-n groups and for each group there's a different threshold. Most of the use cases I've considered or heard from anyone involves having different subgroups with different subthresholds based on which groups are selected. So say you have 4 groups, and you required within those, thresholds of 4-of-5, 4-of-7, etc., but if a different group of the high-level groups have a higher threshold, you might not need as much threshold as the other one. The reason why you would want to do this is not just micro-optimization but it's because you're trying to reduce the risk of loss. You're setting different thresholds so it's unlikely all the groups are going to experience catastrophic loss. These are separate splits.

I don't understand how the math would work for that. They are separate splits. They are somehow linked together. If a particular group appears in one instance as a 3-of-5 and another one as 4-of-5, there are two separate subkeys for that group. My second objection is that this seems much more complex to convey to users. That was our observation from rwot8, that this needs a good user interface design. There was an idea presented there about trust circles or social circles. The reason for the 2 levels is that, while you could nest this as much as you want, two layers is enough where if you had more than that it would be too confusing to users. But how do you represent the tradeoff about representing thresholds? This is why I wanted some of the UX people down here.

At the top layer, you have groups that as a group have specific trust in common. So one of the groups that was here, that was here last time at rwot8 was Ricachet, and they wanted to give out shares to your 100 instant messenger friends as one of the circles. So there they are going for resilience. Maybe it requires only 4 of the 100 to be restored. But because of that, you want to maybe have a family circle that must be able to have their quorum be reached. You want a mix of motivations. Statistically, you want their risk to be independent, which helps you better estimate likelihood of loss. As more groups are added with resilience, even if you require the same number of keys, you might be requiring it from independent groups that are unlikely to experience loss at the same time.

One thing that we could do is a template where we provide like 3 default templates for the users, and they could make an advanced one if they want. SLIP 39 doesn't let you use 4-of-100 because the numbers are limited to like 16. Technically you could have 100 shares, but you would have to strategically break it up into 14 or 16 shares each time. You're not getting this tradeoff, it's just a group of up to 16, and then there could be 16 groups,s o you can work out how many total people you have, but you might want to repeat them across groups too.

The benefit of SSS was large threshold groups. Multisig on bitcoin can't do that without paying high fees and doing presigned chains of transactions to have large multisig groups.

The threshold musig stuff that has been done since last time is drop-in replaceable. It's Shamir secret sharing on the secp curve. Besides the alignment with Bitcoin Core, this gives us a use for the musig work in the context for group signatures that aren't for authorizing bitcoin payments. There's at least five papers in this community where people are asking, how do we let a community sign for something? Especially when you talk about privacy-enhancing things, the wonderful thing about Schnorr is that in the end to verify that final signature, nobody can differentiate it from a single signer versus 100 people signing something. In the end, it's just a single Schnorr signature which helps for better privacy.

This links up with social key recovery. They can't sign for your bitcoin, because bitcoin doesn't support Schnorr yet, but they could sign a message on your behalf indicating something for some other protocol, in addition to being able to recover your bitcoin key.

Under Wyoming law, stockholders can be represented by keys, and all of the records of the company can be represented by cryptographic transactions now. So now we have the ability to say yes, the stockholders did sign the change of policy proposal or the new articles of incorporation because the old articles say it requires 60% of the shares and here are 60% of the shares signing to approve the change. There is also accountability and non-accountability issues that you can grapple with; Pieter Wuille had the tree signatures proposal.
