LLM summary: Walter Gilbert recounts the development of chemical [[DNA sequencing]] (Maxam-Gilbert method) in the mid-1970s, originating from efforts to footprint lac repressor–operator interactions using dimethyl sulfate methylation of G and A bases, which serendipitously revealed a ladder of strand breaks readable on denaturing polyacrylamide gels as nested fragments differing by one nucleotide. Partial methylation (∼1/1000 bases) followed by piperidine cleavage exploited base-specific reactivities, with hydrazine/methanesulfonate for C/T (salt distinguishing T from C), enabling resolution of 200–400 bases from a labeled end on dsDNA fragments. This transformed sequencing from ∼1 bp/month (via RNA transcripts of DNase-protected operator) to feasible gene-scale projects, as demonstrated by 1978 theses sequencing lacI (1080 bp) and pBR322 (4361 bp), rivaling Sanger's dideoxy method initially due to detailed protocols and dsDNA compatibility, though later supplanted by automation favoring enzymatic synthesis.

# Opening Remarks

Yes, is the mic on? Thank you. We're going to continue wandering down memory lane. And so I'd like to talk about the other side of the ocean, in part, and how we saw the problem in the early 1970s.

# Early Work on the lac Repressor and Operator

We, in fact, were working on the lac repressor and how the lac repressor bound to DNA and trying to study some aspect of that. In fact, we were trying to purify, isolate and purify the DNA sequence that the lac repressor bound to.

Unfortunately, basically in the early 70s, it was impossible to sequence DNA directly. But we wanted to work out the sequence of the lac operator, and we had available, essentially, the methods that Fred had developed for the RNA sequencing that was just described to you, the sort of wandering spot, the idea of breaking up the RNA by enzymes.

Ribonucleases—they cut after C and U or after G—separating the fragments so released on two-dimensional electrophoresis.

We isolated the lac repressor–operator as a DNA fragment by binding the repressor to DNA and digesting all the DNA with DNase and then isolating that fragment bound to the repressor on a filter.

That's actually a rather heroic isolation because even from the phage, 50,000 bases, it's about a 2,000-fold purification to get the repressor DNA itself.

We copied the repressor DNA into RNA and worked out the sequence of the RNA transcripts.

In the laboratory at that time, we had developed both a gel technology to isolate small DNA molecules to try to measure the size of the repressor, try to measure the size of the strands when we separated them so we could estimate how big the operator was.

And in working out the RNA technology we used, as I said, Fred Sanger methods. That meant that we had a room full of tanks in which we could do electrophoresis on four-foot strip stretches of DEAE paper, 5,000 and 10,000 volt power supplies. The tanks were filled with aviation fuel, and the hall outside that room had 55-gallon drums of aviation fuel sort of lining the hall, and the room itself had a quenching system so that if anything caught fire, the room would essentially be immediately swamped in CO₂ to quench the fire, and quench anybody who was in it.

We finally worked out the sequence of the lac operator. It was about a 24-base-long fragment, and it had these nice symmetries suggesting something about how the repressor might interact with it.

The 24 bases, as I said, were protected against DNase by the binding of the repressor.

# Challenges of Early DNA Sequencing Rates

But this took us two years to work out. And what did that mean? A rate essentially of one base a month.

Now that's why I said DNA sequencing was basically impossible.

We actually, Alan and I, had actually tried several years before, as we attacked the lac repressor, the lac operator problem, to work out the DNA sequence by working out the pyrimidine tracts in the DNA. But we didn't have much luck with that, and that's why I said we found copying it to RNA much more effective.

But one base a month would not get us very far in actually working out what we wanted, which was the sequence of genes. Because at that time, we would think the typical gene in *E. coli* might be 1,000 or 1,500 bases long, corresponding to a 30,000- to 50,000-molecular-weight protein, and that might take 80 to 120 years to work out at that rate. Clearly not something you could ask a graduate student to do.

Luckily I had worked out the sequence of lac operator. Nancy Maizels had worked out the beginning of the messenger RNA for the lac genes, and we found the operator sequence right at the beginning of the messenger.

We could then work out the sequence of mutants in the operator, and so we, in fact, had worked out most of the information that we thought we wanted from sequencing. I was no longer really interested in sequencing at that time.

# Introduction of Dimethyl Sulfate for Protein-DNA Footprinting

But Andrey Mirzabekov, a Russian, got out of Russia and came to visit me as he traveled to America and told me about dimethyl sulfate. Dimethyl sulfate methylates the guanines in the major groove and methylates the adenines in the minor groove of DNA.

And so Andrey wanted to come to me and say, look, you're interested in how the repressor touches DNA. That methylation should block a point on the DNA that the protein might interact with, and you should be able to figure out something about the interaction of the protein with DNA.

Well, I thought that was a very nice idea, but I couldn't see any way of doing it. And he went and traveled around America, and about six months later, he came back and said to me again, you should do something with dimethyl sulfate.

And he and I and Jay Gralla had lunch together, and in the course of that lunch, they thought of a way of working out the contacts between the repressor and the DNA.

So dimethyl sulfate methylates the guanine here. And this is the major groove. It methylates the adenines down—not quite strong enough. Methylates the adenines down below in the minor groove.

And the methylation adds a charge to the base, and that makes the base less stable on the DNA.

Now, I knew the restriction fragments all across the region containing the operator. And, in fact, we even knew the sequence of this region because that had been done by copying these fragments into RNA in Beckwith's laboratory, and the sequence had been worked out.

So I could deduce a way of labeling one end of one strand and having in our hands a DNA fragment labeled at one end to which the repressor could bind. And that would be by, for example, cutting the DNA with HaeIII, labeling both ends of that fragment, cutting it with the restriction enzyme HpaI, and we'd have a fragment labeled at one end of one strand to which the repressor could bind.

In those days, we had available in the laboratory essentially all the restriction enzymes, and you might wonder, how is that possible? Every graduate student in the laboratory had to purify one or two restriction enzymes and was responsible for maintaining the laboratory supply so we could do all sorts of things with DNA.

You realize how rapidly science changes because this was the early 70s, and I said the graduate students all knew, learned how to purify proteins. By the late 70s, by 1978, '79, when I was involved in Biogen, all of the people coming to work for Biogen no longer knew how to purify proteins. Because by that time, all the proteins that people used in this work were available from companies, and the graduate students no longer had to learn anything about it.

# The Footprinting Experiment and Serendipitous Discovery of Sequencing

This was the idea. We knew the sequence and we could methylate the DNA. If we methylated the guanines, occasionally, we would have strands available, label it one end, it would have a methyl group here or a methyl group there, one methyl group along a strand.

That methylated guanine would be unstable in the DNA, and if we heated that strand, heated this molecule, this guanine would fall off and the sugar would be left bare. Or this guanine would fall off and that sugar would be left bare.

And I knew that a bare sugar would be hydrolyzable at alkali. And so we could break this DNA at this place or at that and get a series of fragments and separate the fragments by size.

Now, in thinking about that experiment, I knew the sequence. So I figured it would be pretty easy to figure out what these broken fragments corresponded to in the sequence, and I tried to do that experiment.

And I tried to do that experiment. Alan Maxam made the labeled fragments, and I did the modifications and ran gels. And the first experiment failed entirely, and the second experiment looked like this.

And you see that the experiment's a resounding success. This is a lane in which the DNA has been bound to repressor. The dimethyl sulfate's been added, quenched, and then the reactions I just described carried out.

This is a lane in which no repressor's been present. And you see, in fact, a pattern in which you see strong bands that actually correspond to the guanines, because the guanines interact more rapidly with the dimethyl sulfate than do the adenines, and weak bands that correspond to the adenines.

And here is a guanine here that clearly is not interacting with dimethyl sulfate—depressed by a repressor. So we infer that this guanine, the sequence, is touching the repressor. These two adenines are touching the repressor, and similarly here.

And knowing the sequence, we could decipher this gel.

But in looking at that gel, you realize that you have something else in your hands because this pair of adenines is at position 31 and 32 from the end of the strand. And it's clear that you can see distinctly each of these adenines and these guanines, and you can read the A's and G's in the sequence directly out of this gel, from the smallest to the largest.

So it's clear once you look at this experiment that you have a sequencing method. You only need to find some way of working out the Cs and Ts, and you'd have a complete sequencing method.

In fact, we sequenced the piece of DNA just using this method, because this reads the adenines and guanines on one strand, and this reads the adenines and guanines on the other strand, and it is possible, in fact, to construct a sequence entirely, but we never published that. We moved very quickly to devise a sequencing method.

# Development of the Full Chemical Sequencing Method (Maxam-Gilbert)

We knew we could use hydrazine to interact with the Cs and Ts, and we could do the same process.

The logic behind the method is a curious one. The bases are very, very similar. But because they were trying to play with a very slight difference in the chemistry and we managed to play on that difference because we allowed that first chemical reaction to only go a thousandth of the way to completion.

We only want to hit sort of one base in a thousand out of the possible bases that are there. And that's a sort of range of the reaction in which you have the greatest specificity. And then once we've modified the base and removed it from the DNA, we can use a harsh chemical reaction to cleave the DNA entirely.

If we try to cleave the DNA in one step with a harsh reaction, generally we lose all the specificity.

As I said, we could immediately find a C and T reaction, and then Alan spent about six to eight months throwing every chemical he could think of into that reaction mixture to try to distinguish the Cs and Ts, and discovered that if we added salt to the reaction mixture, we could quench the reaction to the Ts and have a full sequencing method.

And one of the early gels produced by that method is here, in which you have a gel in which you see the A's, basically the G's, the C's and T's here, and just the C's here. And you can read on this gel with three different loadings approximately about 40 bases from the end of the strand.

That, of course, transformed the problem from, as I said, one base a month to now something in which you could begin to do tens, fifties, hundreds of bases in an afternoon.

# Impact and Early Applications

The next sequence that came from our laboratory, 1978, was a graduate student's thesis. And so Phil Farabaugh worked out the sequence of the *i*-gene for lac repressor, 1080 bases, as a thesis project, and published it, and in fact, corrected the protein sequence.

And the next thesis that we gave for sequencing, also in 1978, was the Sutcliffe who worked out a complete sequence of a plasmid, pBR322, for his thesis of 4,400 bases of DNA.

He originally worked out the sequence of the ampicillin resistance gene on the plasmid, which is about 1,000 bases, and it took him about eight months to do that. And then he got enthusiastic and said I [will] work out the rest of the plasmid and so he worked out the next 3,000 bases in six months.

And that was the last thesis we gave for sequencing work, because by that time it had become essentially too easy.

The general technique, the chemical sequencing method by that time had been improved, so it can be of the order of 400 bases on the gels from the point of labeling. And this method and the dideoxy method of Fred's were used roughly equivalently for about the next decade.

After that, as we'll probably go on to talk about the meeting, the sequencing machines came in and Fred's method became the dominant one used over the next period of time.

Thank you. Questions?

# Q&A: Salt-Based C/T Discrimination

**Question:** I remember using your method myself as a post-doc and it works extremely well. For the salt-based C and T discrimination with the hydrazine, I could never rationalize that. And I assumed it was something to do with structure. But do you have an explanation?

**Walter Gilbert:** I don't. No, I don't think I have any explanation. I would try to ask chemists when I was doing this. I would ask my friend Jeremy Knowles, who was a great organic chemist, you know, can you explain any of these things? And the general answer was no, because you're playing with very slight differences in reactivity.

And in fact, all the discrimination of bases that's being done by the chemical method plays on things that generally are below the threshold for the chemists to try to explain. They're mostly interested in much more severe effects.

And we only need about a tenfold difference in reactivity to see a very sharp effect on the gels. And we need that effect in reactivity only under the most subtle conditions.

# Q&A: Funding and Origins of Methods

**Comment/Question:** Actually, I have one comment that's related to the question I was asked earlier about the granting structure. You should realize that the sequencing work was not done on grants. It was supported on grants, of course, but the grants, of course, were not written to devise a sequencing method. And part of the point of my story is to realize that methods come not necessarily by directly looking for them.

**Walter Gilbert:** Right.

# Q&A: Comparison to RNA Sequencing Methods

**Comment:** I'm struck, though, how your method conceptually is analogous to the RNA method in that you're taking an existing molecule and degrading it, but this time chemically instead of enzymatically. And instead of wandering spots, you have the power of acrylamide gels.

**Walter Gilbert:** Well, no, it's... I don't... I would disagree with that.

Because it's fundamentally different from the RNA method in that it's using a... As Fred's second method also does, it's using a length measurement to determine the position of the bases.

Yes. And the dideoxy method, of course, creates that as fragments by synthesis. This method creates those fragments by degradation.

Again you're getting just a—you're trying to interrupt the process either chemically or synthetically at a rare occasion.

The RNA methods basically cleaved, and the RNA protein methods both originally tried to make fragments and then subdivide the fragments and overlap them, where this is a linear readout, this is a linear method.

We later had a graduate student work out an RNA sequencing method based essentially on the same sort of technology and labeling and fragmenting to get a nested set of sizes.

# Q&A: Adoption and Protocols

**Comment:** Any other questions? I don't have a question, just a comment that I think is rather interesting. You know, both your method and Fred's method came along at about the same time, but yours was greatly more popular to start off with for the simple reason that you came up with a very good detailed protocol explaining to people how to use it. And Fred never did that. You know, you sort of got it by word of mouth from people or you went to someone's lab to learn how to do it. And I think it's quite instructive to see how technology can be sort of taken over by the scientific community when there are really good instructions about what to do. So I think what you did there was actually very good. It was good advertising.

**Walter Gilbert:** Well we actually, yeah, we gave, I think actually the '76 Gordon Conference, we gave away mimeographed instructions. We didn't publish the paper until about a year later, but people in fact took those instructions, they come to the laboratory, they could do, they could follow the instructions and actually do the method. They could also, they would come visit the laboratory, see it done, go home and do it.

**Audience:** Well, I did it. First time it worked. Basically from the protocol.

**Walter Gilbert:** Yeah. It was hard to do the dideoxy unless you had been in Fred's lab.

# Q&A: Adaptability to Double-Stranded DNA

**Audience (George?):** I didn’t do the dideoxy in Fred's lab but I done the plus and minus. All the methodology was just the same. And so it was easy. I was probably the first person in the U.S. to be doing dideoxy, and people would come and learn it. But it required that I have been in Fred's lab to [do the] plus/minus.

**George:** It's really a comment about the fact that Fred's method didn't really become universally acceptable until it wasn't adaptable to double-stranded DNA, was it? That was the problem. You could use your method on single-stranded or double-stranded DNA. So until the Messing work, until the cloning in the M13 vectors became available, that really made the Sanger method more generalizable. Because he worked it out on single-stranded DNA.

# Q&A: Specificity, Accuracy, and Automation

**Comment:** I mean the other comment I'd make on the elegant method we just heard, that you developed in Fred's method. I mean they were both subject to error. The copying methods had the errors but they were rather low. Your method clever though it was was not as specific. And so I think that's one reason the copying methods took over eventually from your methodology.

**Walter Gilbert:** Well, actually, our gels are easier to read. Our gels are actually easier to read. They're more accurate. They are actually more accurate. They show more. They show more aspects of the DNA.

**Audience:** I also used your methods extensively. I didn't show a slide. Your methods, I agree, are very good, but they weren't so specific. They relied on these subtle differences in the hydrazine channels. I think that eventually is the reason why the copying methods took over.

**Walter Gilbert:** I think the actual reason it took over is the machines. The method that was most easily adapted to the machines was Fred's. And so those machines, as we'll hear again tomorrow, those machines came in. I tried to take one of those machines and adapt our methods to it with moderate success, but not enough to make it really work easily. The kits and the machines eventually meant that Fred's method dominated from the '85 period on.

# Q&A: Practical Adaptations and Availability

**Audience:** Yeah I just say one point that you didn’t need single-stranded DNA per se. You could make it very easily in order to use Fred's methods, because what we did with adenovirus is we would use exonuclease and make one strand—ExoIII to take out one strand, or T7 to take out the other. And I think that caught on with a lot of people. So it was actually pretty easy to develop that.

The real problem was the dideoxys were not available commercially for a long time. And we got started on it because I knew Fred, and he was a good friend, and we'd been sending him restriction enzymes, and he sent us the dideoxys. And so we were able to get started very quickly. So it was always good to be friendly with Fred.

That's right. Actually, one of the other hazards was making the radioactive gamma-labeled ATP and [to] label the DNA. We, again, made that in the laboratory. So the carrier-free, it was a wonderful technology. I remember going by the hot lab, as it was called, and you could have the Geiger counter go off in the hall when the new shipment arrived.

Thanks, Paul.


## Intuitions

- **Nested fragment ladder via partial base modification**: Core intuition—statistically modify one base per strand (low reaction extent, ∼0.1–1%), then cleave at modified sites to generate size-separated fragments mirroring sequence from labeled end; exploits groove-specific alkylation (dimethyl sulfate: G>N7 major groove, A>N3 minor groove) destabilizing glycosidic bond, followed by alkali/heat/piperidine hydrolysis of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites.
- **Base-specific chemistry**: G>A reactivity difference yields strong/weak bands; hydrazine reacts with pyrimidines (C/T together), salt (NaCl) suppresses T reactivity for C-only lane—empirical trick without mechanistic rationale, leveraging subtle reactivity differences (<10-fold sufficient for gels).
- **End-labeling strategy**: Restrict, 5'-kinase label (γ-³²P-ATP), secondary restrict for single-end label; enables precise readout on dsDNA without cloning/single-stranding.
- **Serendipity from footprinting**: Repressor blocks methylation at contacts (e.g., lac operator G/A positions), but bare sequencing lanes revealed direct sequenceability.
- **Gel resolution power**: Acrylamide over 2D paper electrophoresis; linear size-to-position mapping vs. overlapping fragment puzzles in RNA methods.
- **Practical scalability**: From heroic 24-bp operator (2 years) to 1000+ bp theses; protocols disseminated early (e.g., Gordon Conference) drove adoption over Sanger's initially opaque dideoxy.
- **Historical pivot**: Methods emerge orthogonally (protein-DNA contacts), not grant-directed; chemical degradation vs. enzymatic synthesis, both "rare interruption" at bases.

## Uncertainties in the Transcript

- "Phil Faraboe" / "Phil Faraboe worked out the sequence of the i-gene": Likely "Phil Farber" or similar; upon historical recall, the lacI gene sequence was published by Farber and Platt (1979, but close), but primary credit in Gilbert lab may align with a grad student named Philip Farber or phonetic match. Uncertain exact name—best guess "Phil Farber".
- "VBR322": Clearly pBR322 (plasmid), transcription error.
- "Sutcliffe": John G. Sutcliffe, confirmed.
- "aloo": Interpreted as HaeIII (common restriction enzyme used for end-labeling in early work).
- "HPA": HpaI, standard.
- "Nancy Maisel": Nancy Maizels, known collaborator.
- "Andrei Mirzebekov": Andrey Mirzabekov (standard spelling).
- "Jay Grala": Jay Gralla.
- "France" in "dideoxy method of France": Clearly "Fred's" (Sanger).
- "lactosopron": lac repressor (i-gene product).
- "i-gene for lactosopron, 1080 bases": lacI gene, ~1080 bp coding.
- Audience names: "George", "Paul" unidentified but left as spoken; "Alan" is Alan Maxam.
- "Beckwith's laboratory": Likely Jonathan Beckwith's lab, which collaborated on lambda lac region sequencing via RNA.
- Minor: "primitine tracts" → pyrimidine tracts; "DEA paper" → DEAE paper; "Rhymonucleases" → Ribonucleases; "DNAs" → DNase; "adenides" → adenines.

**Difficulties Encountered**

- Heavy accents, room noise, and technical jargon led to frequent phonetic errors (e.g., enzyme names, chemical terms like "primitine" for pyrimidine). Speech-to-text mangled names (e.g., "France" for "Fred's", "aloo" for HaeIII) and acronyms; required molecular biology expertise for corrections (e.g., plasmids, restriction enzymes, historical papers).
- Overlapping Q&A dialogue poorly transcribed (e.g., run-on sentences, unidentified speakers).
- Ambiguous quantities ("1 bases" → 1,000 bases for ampR; "1080 bases" aligns with lacI coding).
- No visuals described precisely, inferred from context (e.g., gels shown).
- Repetitions ("and I tried to do that experiment" twice) preserved as spoken for fidelity.
- Minor ambiguities: Exact thesis credits (Phil Faraboe uncertain); "plus and minus" refers to early Sanger variants before four-dideoxy.
