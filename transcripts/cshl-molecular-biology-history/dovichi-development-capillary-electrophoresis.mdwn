LLM summary: Norman Dovichi chronicles the evolution of capillary electrophoresis (CE) for high-throughput DNA sequencing, originating from his postdoc work at Los Alamos on sheath-flow cuvettes enabling attogram- and zeptomole-level laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection—pioneering single-molecule sensitivity. Integrating this with Jorgenson's CE for automated, efficient separations, he addressed slab-gel limitations in early dye-labeled automated sequencers (e.g., Lloyd Smith's primer dyes, Ansorge's slab fluorescence, Prober's terminator dyes). In 1988, he sketched a multi-capillary array instrument, DOE-funded despite initial rejections, yielding a 16/32-capillary system with chopper-multiplexed argon/YAG lasers imaging to photodiode arrays. Pivotal separations shifted from unstable cross-linked polyacrylamide to linear polyacrylamide, countering bias reptation—a field-dependent entanglement transition limiting read lengths—via modest fields (<300 V/cm) and elevated temperatures (>60°C), which serendipitously extended the Ogston-to-reptation transition (N*) while resolving compressions from secondary structure, achieving ~600-base four-color Sanger reads on M13mp18 and GC-rich bacterial genes, including the first CE-generated GenBank entries in 1997.

# Introduction

It's a pleasure to be here. It's an honor to be here. Thank you very much for the opportunity.

I'm going to talk about development of capillary electrophoresis for DNA sequencing. I'll begin showing you some data technology that was developed before the beginning of the genome project, and we've had a good introduction to it. I'm going to take a slightly different tack on this.

# Postdoctoral Work at Los Alamos

I had done my postdoctoral fellowship at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in Dick Keller's lab. And Dick's a physical chemist and I was there to do physical chemistry.

Through a series of happy accidents I spent half of my time in a biophysics group doing flow cytometry. And we investigated flow cytometry as a tool for ultra sensitive detection.

In flow cytometry, samples introduced into the center of a square optically flat flow chamber. Sheath fluid surrounds the analyte and draws it out as a thin filament which passes through the laser beam, fluorescence excited, filtered and sent to detector. We investigated that.

# Ultrasensitive Detection in Sheath-Flow Cuvettes

I moved and took an independent position at the University of Wyoming. And when I was there, I and my colleagues at Los Alamos wrote a paper which we published in Science which described attogram detection limits for aqueous dye samples.

And what we demonstrated is this sheath flow cuvette, laser-induced fluorescence combination, provides exquisite sensitivity. And at the bottom there we have on average only half a Rhodamine 6G molecule was present in the 6 picoliter probe volume. And this was the genesis of all single molecule detections.

We have a second follow-up paper which articulated how to achieve single molecule detection. And it represented a couple of order of magnitude improvement detection limits compared to alternatives.

And so this technology based on the sheath flow cuvette provides extremely high sensitivity, extremely wide dynamic range, but it requires small samples, picoliter to nanoliter volume samples. And it provides no information as to the identity of the analyte other than the fluorescent signature.

# Introduction to Capillary Zone Electrophoresis

Later that year, Jim Jorgenson published his review article on capillary zone electrophoresis. Jim and I were undergraduates together at Northern Illinois University and followed each other's work fairly closely.

In this particular paper, Jim points out that capillary electrophoresis provides an approach to automating, instrumentizing, as he put it, electrophoresis. Because conventional electrophoresis because of the gel is not easy to adapt it to online sample applications detection quantification or automated operation. So modern electrophoresis, powerful, but not automated.

In capillary electrophoresis, a fused silica capillary is looped between two sample reservoirs. High voltage is applied, a sample is injected into the capillary and analytes separated across the capillary.

Capillaries are made out of fused silica. I brought a capillary with me. Here is one capillary. You can't see it. If I had two capillaries, they would look like this. Here, you can pass it around for your amusement.

These things cost about a buck a meter. The reason why we use 150 micrometer outer diameter capillary is because that's the cheapest capillary that we could purchase.

The high surface-to-volume ratio of the capillary allows efficient radiation of heat and application and use of high voltages. These capillaries are flexible. You can tie that thing in a knot. Can support high electric fields, which leads to fast and efficient separations.

They use ridiculously small sample volumes, nanoliter injection volumes, but they require sensitive detection, picomolar better.

# Combining CE with LIF Detection

So it seems reasonable then to combine the two technologies. In, when was it? I guess it was in 88, Yongfeng Cheng, who moved with me from the University of Wyoming to the University of Alberta, where all of the subsequent work was done, coupled capillary electrophoresis to laser-induced fluorescence in the sheath flow cuvette, and we studied fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled amino acids as an approach to high-sensitivity protein sequencing, which went nowhere.

But we achieved detection limits down in what we now called the zeptomole range. We rapidly improve this down to single molecule detection.

The combination of the techniques then provides fast and efficient separations so you know what your analyte is and then also provides the optimal detection limit, essentially infinite sensitivity.

# Pre-Genome Automated Slab-Gel Sequencers

Now, a second bit of pre-genome instrumentation was reviewed by Lloyd and Leroy, and that's the automated DNA sequencers. I'll highlight three papers.

The first, of course, is their Nature paper which used dye-labeled primers. A second paper was published by Ansorge which used fluorescent dye, single fluorescent dye, and essentially replaced the radioactive label with a fluorescent label in classic slab gel electrophoresis.

I was not aware of those two papers when they were published I did not subscribe to either of those journals I did subscribe to Science and when Prober paper came out with dye-labeled terminators I became very interested very excited.

So the first technology was commercialized by ABI the second one by Pharmacia, and the third one briefly by DuPont. And these technologies replace the radioactive label with fluorescence detection. It eliminates autoradiography and an automated sequence calling, extremely powerful tools for DNA analysis.

They use, though, slab gels, and slab gels cannot support high electric fields. They provide slow separations. Gel preparation is tedious, and sample loading is manual.

# Conception of Multi-Capillary Array Instrument

And then finally, I recognize all of this, put it together, and flying to Boston on November 1st, 1988, this is something I never do. I jotted down an idea, and I saved the piece of paper. and scanned this a couple of days ago.

And I designed a multiple capillary, a capillary array electrophoresis instrument. And then the idea was we would take our sheath flow cuvette and instead of using a square flow chamber, we'd use a rectangular flow chamber.

We'd take an array of capillaries, sort of like the teeth on a comb, and put them inside of that rectangular flow chamber. Sheath flow would then surround the capillaries, draw analyte out as thin filaments, excite with a single laser beam, collect fluorescence at the side, and image onto a camera of some sort.

We didn't have funding for that. But later the next year, the following notice appeared in Chemical and Engineering News that the Department of Energy was going to start developing technology for the Human Genome Initiative.

And one of the topics they were interested in was the development of innovative and cost-effective technologies, leading to rapid and accurate large-scale sequencing.

# Instrument Development and Funding

So now I'm going to describe the capillary electrophoresis instrumentation and then the separation technology. For the instrumentation, we obtained funding from DOE, developed a capillary array electrophoresis instrument based on that original design.

Here are 32 capillaries sitting inside of a rectangular chamber. The capillaries flow from the top or pass through the top into the center of the chamber. The capillaries are arrayed linearly, sheath buffers pumped in, flows out the bottom.

Here's operation for 16 capillaries. Laser beam skims beneath the tip of the capillaries. Analyte flows off the capillaries, focused into the laser beam fluorescence is collected and imaged Photograph or diagram of the instrument

# Detection System Details

We use the green laser that this laser the frequency doubled neodymium YAG also the argon ion laser. We'd use the two lasers because we were using ABI's dye set. Chopper will alternate, excite the two fluorescent dyes.

Beams are combined at a dichroic beam splitter, focused with an objective into the cuvette, collected, passed through the same filter wheel that Lloyd used and just described, image onto a array of gradient index lens coupled optical fibers, to have large photodiodes.

We had the photodiodes at minus 20 degrees Celsius. This was Edmonton in winter, so we heated the detectors to minus 20, because outside it was minus 30 to minus 40 when we were doing these experiments.

A photograph of the instrument in operation, two laser beams, chopped dichroic filter, and sent on to the instrument, or to the cuvette.

For the graduate students in the audience, the quiz for today is how was this photograph taken?

# Early Sequencing Data

We used M13mp18 a lot as our test system, and here is data off of that 16 capillary instrument. Here's the penta-T quartet-T in the M13 sequence at about 325 nucleotides, and you see exquisite reproducibility from capillary to capillary.

# Parallel Development by Hitachi and Commercialization

Simultaneously, in parallel and independently, Hitachi came up with exactly the same idea. The two patents or patents from the two groups were combined by Perkin-Elmer, which had Applied Biosystems at that time, developed the model 3700 DNA sequencer, blah, blah, blah.

The 3700 analyzer is designed for customers who require ultra-high throughput, 24-hour multi-run unattended automation and operating costs that meet the requirement of very large projects such as completion of the sequencing phase of the human genome. Cool.

# Separation Technology Challenges: Cross-Linked Polyacrylamide

There's a big step though between the hardware and the instrumentation and it has to do with its details and the separation. I'm going to spend the rest of my talk going through this.

In 1990, four groups jumped on the bandwagon of developing high throughput sequencers, or capillary electrophoresis as DNA sequencing tools. Four papers appeared in 1990.

First one was by Harold Swerdlow, who was a graduate student in Richard Gesteland's lab at Utah. one was out of Lloyd Smith's group. Lloyd tells me they were the first ones to submit on the manuscript.

Another two papers, one from Barry Karger and one from my group, appeared back-to-back issues of J. Chromatogr.

Swerdlow introduced himself to me at a conference, and we arranged for him to spend nine months at Alberta teaching us how to do DNA sequencing. We taught him details of capillary electrophoresis and laser-induced fluorescence. Remember this is Alberta. cold there, and so Swerdlow was a dedicated student to go up there.

All the early technologies used the same gel chemistry that was used in slab gels. This is cross-linked polyacrylamide.

As Harold pointed out in a paper, efforts to exploit this technology have been hampered by problems with the reproducibility and instability of gels. That's an understatement. You had to throw the gels away after one or two operations, which reduces the opportunity for automation.

# Breakthrough: Linear Polyacrylamide

This was pretty quickly identified by the community and there's a series of papers dealing with this issue, the use of linear polyacrylamide.

I highlight this paper from Boček's group in the Czech Republic, Czechoslovakia at that time, and they use non-cross-linked polyacrylamide. Linear polyacrylamide solution.

These things have the viscosity of syrup and can be pumped into the capillary. And as he says, or they say at the bottom, the time-consuming in-capillary polymerization step could be avoided and fast and reproducible repetition of the analysis was assured.

It's the key breakthrough that allowed the automation of capillary electrophoresis for DNA sequencing.

Here's some M13 data again. This is a T-terminated ladder. You'll see the classic exponential decrease in peak amplitude as you go later in the run, which is a hallmark of the Sanger sequencing reaction.

I'll highlight the penta-T, quartet-T, and you see the beautifully uniformly spaced peaks. This non-cross-linked acrylamide works beautifully for these short fragments.

# Bias-Reptation Phenomenon

Unfortunately, for large fragments, you see this big blob at the end of the run. And this big blob is associated with a phenomenon called bias-reptation.

And we worked a lot with Gary Slater at the University of Ottawa and Jean-Louis Viovy at the Institute Curie to begin to understand this phenomenon to characterize it.

And what you observe if you plot migration time versus fragment length is a region where you operate under Ogston separation mechanism where the DNA takes on a random coil configuration.

Later in the run this reptation phenomenon occurs where the DNA becomes stretched out in a line and moves through the gel as a snake crawls through grass. This leads to a co-migration, where all of these fragments above a certain threshold have the same migration time and cannot be resolved.

So this reptation becomes more important at high fields. So we're interested in high fields to speed up the separation.

# Electric Field Trade-Offs

At 100 volts per centimeter, we see a four-hour separation. At 250 volts per centimeter, we're down to an hour-long separation. At 300 volts per centimeter, we're under an hour for the separation.

Unfortunately, reptation is worse at high fields and the read length drops. So there's a trade-off between the electric field that one uses and the read length that you obtain.

This is described by a parameter called N*, which is the onset of bias reptation and where reptation becomes devastating. At low electric fields, you can get good separations out to very large fragments, but as you increase the electric field to 300 volts per centimeter, the fragment lengths drop.

So it's a trade-off between fragment length and speed.

# Temperature Effects on Separations

Simultaneously and independently, we were looking at heating to relax compressions. Here's the compressions in the M13 sequence at the bottom. Peaks are jumbled at the top at 60 degrees Celsius. The peaks are uniformly spaced.

Fortuitously, we observed that heating relaxes reptation for linear polyacrylamide, not for cross-linked, but for linear polyacrylamide. And what we observed is the big blob at the end of the run decreases as we increased temperature.

and we had the serendipitous and wonderful observation that N*, the onset of bias reptation, gets better and better for long, becomes longer and longer fragments the higher temperature you run.

So we have a wonderful situation where higher temperature provides faster separations and allows longer read length.

We summarized this in our paper in 95. To obtain long read lengths, it is necessary to operate capillaries in modest electric fields. to obtain data that's free of compression and relaxed bias reptation necessary to operate the capillary at elevated temperature and to make an automated instrument is necessary to use non polyacrylamide.

# Four-Color Sequencing Achievements

We did this used it demonstrated four color sequencing on M13 Here the first 320 bases There the penta-T quartet-T And then we were able to call the sequence reasonably well out to about 600 bases in a couple of hour operation.

# Real-World Applications

We not only worked with M13, we worked with a number of real samples. We were affiliated with the Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network. We worked with Roger Levesque to look at some Pseudomonas sequences. Those are very GC-rich fragments, terribly compression-ridden. And that led to the development of the high temperature.

And we also worked with Tony Chow who is interested in using heat shock protein as a marker for species identification of bacteria.

We submitted this particular set of data. When did we submit this? In, in, in, in. Yeah, there it is, March 11, 1997. And that was the first data in GenBank generated using capillary electrophoresis.

We ended up doing a dozen different species or sequencing this heat shock protein off of a dozen different species.

# Acknowledgments

All right, acknowledgments. Our first five proposals on this particular topic were not funded. The sixth one was funded by Department of Energy. We were in Canada at the time and so greatly appreciated receiving U.S. funding on this project. I think represents an impressive example of the vision of the Department of Energy.

Once we had funding from the U.S. funding agencies, Canadian funding agencies gave us money. The Genetic Diseases Network was headed up by Michael Smith. The Bacterial Diseases Network, I mentioned a couple of researchers there, Tony Chow and Roger Levesque. Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council finally supported us. And then we had industrial support from MDS-Sciex.

Acknowledged two people, Harold Swerdlow. Harold was a graduate student in bioengineering at Utah working with Richard Gesteland. He was lonely. He met me at a conference, and we got him up to Alberta, where he spent nine months with us, and he taught us how to do DNA sequencing, an incredibly valuable contribution to our project.

And then finally, Zhang Zhang was a graduate student who developed our first multiple capillary array electrophoresis instrument, and I acknowledge his contribution to the project.

And I thank you. Thank you. Are there any questions or comments?

# Q&A: Funding History

So you gave us a litany of not elite institutions that you migrated through and you talked about not getting funded until your fifth cycle Who paid for all this stuff then? And if you were doing it now, would this be funded by a commercial partner?

You asked two questions. So the first question, how is this supported? I was fortunate to get a very good fellowship in Canada called the Stacy Fellowship, which provided me on Canadian standards a large amount of money, on U.S. standards not. And I was free to use it as I chose. And so that was a three-year grant, and I blew all of the money on it. I spent down to the last few pennies to get the project going.

The second question is, would this be funded by industry today? No. My experience with industry is not happy. and contentious. And I do not have a knack of talking to industry. I do not have a knack of negotiating with industry. But I know. Other comments?

# Q&A: Reptation vs. Compressions

Hello. I think you used your term. Is it reptation and compression interchangeably?

Of course, Sanger described compression, and he thought that was due to local secondary structure in the DNA that he was separating on his gels. And that's why I think he decided to raise the temperature. But it wasn't well defined on gels. But we all knew that you had to run your gels hot if you wanted to avoid these compressions. You are absolutely correct.

I conflated the two in my talk because of time. And compressions, indeed, are a result of secondary structure. The reptation, and I guess you can describe it as a secondary structure, but it's independent of sequence and is a different phenomenon.

And we were well aware that gels were classically run at high temperatures. When you try to do gels, the cross-linked gels at high temperature, you have the unfortunate situation that read length drops. So this N* parameter, the onset of bias reptation gets worse and dramatically worse when you raise temperatures.

And the concern with the non-cross-linked polyacrylamide is the material would elute from the column, pump out of the column because its viscosity would drop.

And we though were forced to do this because these ugly samples that Roger Levesque gave us were unsequenceable without relaxing the compressions, without relaxing, yeah, secondary structure.

So when I talk to students about this project, I point out that you can't just use standard materials because we were really good at doing M13. We were so good we didn't have to load a sample and we could call the sequence, right? But you have to work with real samples because the real samples will reveal the limitations of the technology. and that leads to the improvements that work.

Thank you for explaining it to me. Other comments?

# Q&A: Temperature and Band Broadening

I was just curious about how you disentangle temperature effects and the electrophoretic mechanism, in other words, reptation versus temperature broadening. Because temperature broadening will also cause loss of resolution.

So Lloyd is referring to a subtle aspect of capillary electrophoresis. In capillary electrophoresis the driving force is uniform across the diameter cross of the capillary which gives rise to a flat flow profile Anything that distorts this flat flow profile is going to lead to band broadening So you don't want any pressure flow which will give you a parabolic flow profile

If you have a temperature gradient across the diameter of the capillary, that temperature gradient leads to a viscosity gradient, which leads to a velocity gradient, which leads to peak broadening.

We were pretty obsessive in keeping our electric fields under control so that we were not generating a significant amount of joule heating in the capillaries. So a routine would be to generate an ohms plot, measuring current versus voltage, and make sure that we were well within the linear range.

And one of the beauties or fortuitous aspects of working with the non-crosslinked acrylamide is that it didn't work well at high temperatures, or rather high voltages, and we worked below 300 volts per centimeter,

Whereas the cross-link material, we operated up at 1,000 volts per centimeter. You get these ridiculously short separations, five minutes, and you get 200 bases of sequence. But at any rate, so we operated under conditions to minimize the band broadening associated with the temperature profile.

Any other comments?

## Intuitions

- **Sheath-flow cuvette LIF**: Core to ultrasensitive (attogram/zeptomole/single-molecule) detection via hydrodynamic focusing into thin filaments, wide dynamic range, but demands tiny volumes; genesis of all single-molecule fluorescence methods.
- **CE advantages**: Fused-silica capillaries enable high fields (fast/efficient separations, nL injections) due to superior heat dissipation vs. slab gels; automatable sans gels.
- **Multi-capillary array**: Parallelization via linear capillary comb in rectangular sheath-flow chamber, single laser excitation, side fluorescence imaging to photodiode array; chopper/dichroics for multi-wavelength (ABI dyes); led to ABI 3700.
- **Linear vs. cross-linked polyacrylamide**: Linear polymer solutions enable syringe-pump replacement (automation, reproducibility) vs. unstable/irreproducible in-capillary polymerization of cross-linked gels.
- **Bias reptation**: Mechanistic insight—Ogston (random coil sieving) transitions to reptation (chain reptates snake-like through pores) at N* fragments; field-accelerated (trade-off: speed vs. read length); sequence-independent co-migration "blob".
- **High-temperature trick**: Relaxes sequence-specific compressions (secondary structure) *and* serendipitously delays/extends N* in linear polyacrylamide (unlike cross-linked); faster diffusion aids disengagement, enabling ~600 nt reads at modest fields (<300 V/cm, >60°C).
- **Joule heating control**: Ohms plots ensure linear regime, minimizing radial temperature/viscosity gradients → parabolic flow → band broadening.
- **Real samples drive innovation**: M13 excels on standards but GC-rich Pseudomonas/heat-shock genes reveal compressions, forcing high-T solutions.
