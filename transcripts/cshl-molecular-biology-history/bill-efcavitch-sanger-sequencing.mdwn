LLM-generated summary: Bill Efcavitch details his pivotal role in advancing [[Sanger sequencing|sanger sequencing]] at Applied Biosystems from 1981 to 1999, emphasizing the industrialization of academic innovations into robust platforms. Key developments include dye-labeled primers isolated via slab gel electrophoresis, fluorescent chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides inspired by Prober and Trainor, energy-transfer BigDye terminators to mitigate differential excitation, the 377 slab gel instrument with CCD-based simultaneous four-color detection and gel cooling for >4x throughput gains, and capillary electrophoresis systems like the Model 310 and 3700 featuring linear polydimethylacrylamide (PDMA) polymers to suppress electroosmotic flow (EOF) while enabling dynamic filling. These innovations, alongside cycle sequencing protocols, addressed slab gel limitations, supported the Human Genome Project's demands, and resulted in over 30,000 instruments shipped, with ~15,000 still operational for diagnostics, forensics (e.g., STR genotyping), and NGS validation.

# Introduction and Overview

Well, I want to thank the organizer of the conference for asking me to come by and represent a piece of history that I participated in. And obviously, since I'm no longer with Applied Biosystems, or Applied Biosystems doesn't even exist anymore, I'm representing the work of lots and lots of people.

What I'm going to focus on today is my involvement in technology development from 1981 to 1999 at Applied Biosystems. So I'm not going to speak about each of the platforms. This is a slide that the people at Thermo Fisher Scientific gave me recently, which just shows the arc of Sanger sequencing platforms.

I'm not going to talk about the 373 because Lloyd's already done a really good job giving us a background of that, and [[Norm practically gave my entire talk when he talked about the development of capillary electrophoresis|transcripts/cshl-molecular-biology-history/dovichi-development-capillary-electrophoresis]]. But what I decided to do was to pick a couple of technologies that I thought were really critical and that we had to work out in the process of putting these platforms together.

As I said, Norm has done an excellent job touching on quite a few of these. But to my mind, other than the instruments themselves, which is a lot of work and it's solid engineering, these were pieces of technology that at Applied Biosystems we had to take from academics who published this work and incorporated into robust products that never gave any of you any trouble at all. Right? Right, Jane?

# Early Reflections on Sequencing Evolution

Anyway, this is the beginning, and as I was listening to some of the speakers, especially the bioinformatics, it's amazing that at one time we thought you had to have a printer with a DNA sequencer as an accessory, but that was a long, long time ago.

But I'd like to, you know, my own involvement was before the beginning, and this is Fred Sanger's Nobel Prize speech, which was in 1980, and he makes this comment that [[synthetic oligonucleotides|dna/synthesis/notes]] were hard to come by, that even in 1980 it was preferred to use restriction fragments and we heard that from a couple of people.

# Background in DNA Synthesis with Marvin Caruthers

So I had the good fortune to start my career as a postdoc in the lab of Marvin Caruthers in DNA synthesis because when I went there I thought wow, isolating DNA, that's troublesome. What if I could make it? That might be useful.

And little did I know, but here's the first DNA synthesizer that we developed at Applied Biosystems being installed in Marvin Caruthers' laboratory, and that was the obligatory me as a young man picture with hair.

# Development of Dye-Labeled Primers

So my involvement was helping Steve Fung and some of the people in the DNA sequencing group to isolate these dye-labeled primers. So as Lloyd told us, that was the first embodiment of sequencing.

And what you're looking at here is my favorite medium to work with, which is slab gel electrophoresis, where this is a preparative gel looking at UV shadowing and then looking at the fluorescently labeled primers, which I cut out, and then the organic chemists were using those as authentic standards in their development work.

# Key Advancements in Sequencing Chemistries

So switching gears a bit then, as Lloyd pointed out, I think that one of the background technologies to all the DNA sequencing that we did at Applied Biosystems revolved around chemistries.

And to me, it's frankly amazing that, and as late as 1981, David Ward was teaching us that you could use polymerases to incorporate not just natural nucleotides, but highly decorated and complex nucleotides, which is, I mean, an amazing compression of time.

And then, of course, although Applied Biosystems were advancing the primer-based sequencing, we had the Prober and Trainor paper that talked about the use of fluorescent chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides. And then certainly at Applied Biosystems, we jumped on that.

There was a very talented set of organic chemists, Steve Mentzer, Steve Fung, Linda Lee, et cetera, who rapidly jumped on to developing the different kinds of fluorophores.

# Iterative Optimization of Dye Chemistries

And this is an old slide that I dug out of my garage, and you can tell by the fancy coloring. But it basically, I think, one of the things that we did exceptionally well at Applied Biosystems was having this depth in organic chemistry as was noted by several speakers having disparate groups of people engineers scientists organic chemists et cetera, gave us a lot of ability to rapidly cycle through different dye molecules because those had to be matched to enzymes and as you've heard different performances, you've at enzyme selectivities based on the dyes, et cetera.

So there was this constant back and forth, and although I'm sure you as customers hated it as the different versions came out, they were always in attempt to optimize the performance to get cleaner signals, flatter signals, to remove the irregularities in the signals, et cetera.

So that was, I think, a significant part, and although ABI certainly was noted for being an instrument company, we had tremendous power in our chemistry.

# Advantages of Dye Terminator Chemistries

Obviously, terminators were a big deal. They immediately allowed you to go from preparing four samples to preparing one sample, a four-fold increase in your sample preparation. And so that was clearly a step in the right direction.

Along the ways, we realized that, and I believe it was Lloyd mentioned, that the fact that because you're using a single excitation line, you're getting differential excitation of the four dye molecules. These are actually mislabeled. These names should be up here, such that the fourth dye is the furthest away from the excitation.

And so by definition, you're going to get an uneven pattern. So at that point, we said, well, we should look at energy transfer dyes.

# Invention and Naming of BigDye Terminators

And that is the idea that where one dye is the acceptor of the laser light and transfers that, sorry, one dye accepts the laser light, that being the one closest to the excitation line, and then transfers that to an emitter.

And I will take credit for coming up with the name. These dyes were commercialized when Linda came out of the laboratory and showed me the structures. I made the following comment.

And in a commercial organization, the product manager, when they're gonna put a product out, they hold a little contest and they solicit names. And one of my wags one of my colleagues said let’s call them BFDs. And luckily the product manager had the common sense to shorten that name to BigDyes.

And so if in case you wondering that how the name came about and I'll take credit for it thank you. But I'm from Philadelphia and so it's you know common to use that kind of language so anyway.

# Joining the DNA Sequencing Group and Platform Development

So then I joined the DNA sequencing group in about 92. I was asked by management to do the next versions of sequencers. I was actually given the task of developing a high-throughput slab platform to replace the 373 slab gel electrophoresis and also to develop a capillary electrophoresis platform.

So we actually managed during that, during the time between 93 and 95, to develop two separate platforms simultaneously, which was pretty challenging, I thought.

# Development of the 377 Slab Gel Platform

And the first rule, you know, the first order that came down from management was, you know, to take the slab gel platform and make it go faster.

Well, you know, it didn't take a lot of thinking that the existing platform used a filter wheel where you had to do four scans back and forth to acquire four-color data to interrogate one of the bands. And CCD cameras were now finally becoming cheap enough that one could think about putting them into scientific instrumentation.

So again, it's hard to imagine. This is like 1995, and yet we said, well, an immediate four-fold faster would be if we could replace a filter wheel and PMT with a CCD camera and collect all the spectral light simultaneously.

And sure enough, we did that, and that was the embodiment of the 377. So both the combination of the CCD camera to collect four colors simultaneously and using some cooling on the gel to run it hotter allowed us to get actually more than a four-fold throughput on the 377.

And it turned out that having that, I mean, it's probably like a no-brainer today, but having that CCD camera where we went from fixed filters to virtual filters also gave us a lot of freedom in chemistries. We could change dye chemistries much more quickly and didn't have to worry about hardware upgrades to the platforms.

# Throughput Variations of the 377

So about 1996, this was the plethora of accessories and throughputs that one could have. So you can see that the base level 377 was in fact significantly faster than the 373s. And then there were all these different variations, XL for running, but you guys know all this since you used these platforms.

# Transition to Capillary Electrophoresis

So again, at that same time, we were asked to develop two new platforms, and the second one was going to be a capillary electrophoresis platform.

And as Norm has already done a job saying, there was a large number of individuals who were publishing in capillary electrophoresis, Lloyd himself and then others, and so it seemed like it was a very rational way to go to replace the slab gels, which were problematic.

And implementing a capillary electrophoresis instrument was relatively straightforward from hardware engineering standpoint. But as, again, Norm pointed out, the big issue was the CE separation medium.

# Challenges in Capillary Separation Polymers

And that was actually what the struggle was. I mean, pretty quickly, ABI had already commercialized a UV-based capillary electrophoresis platform. So we understood that hardware. But coming up with a separation polymer.

And as again was said, you couldn't really commercialize capillaries with a cross-linked polymer in them, so we had to struggle to develop the right kind of separation medium.

Steve mentioned one of my colleagues actually was working on this quite novel and amazing PEG system with fluorocarbon tails, so it formed a thixotropic gel that is under pressure it would flow, but in a static condition, it would set up almost like a cross-linked polymer.

So he was trying to mimic a cross-linked polymer that was flowable under pressure. Pretty unique, and in fact, we actually commercialized that, but its separatory powers wasn't that great.

In the end, we settled on a linear polydimethylacrylamide. Turns out that although polyacrylamides are really good at separating DNAs, dimethylacrylamide has a surface property that allows it to bind to the inside of the capillary suppress the electroosmotic flow and turned out to be a superior embodiment.

And that's the polymer that fills all the capillaries that Applied Biosystems has sold.

# Introduction of the Model 310

So in 1996, we developed a Model 310, which was a single capillary platform. And I remember when we introduced this, I was speaking at a meeting, and someone said, you know, oh my god, human genome, why are you developing a low-throughput platform?

And it turns out it was easier to learn what we needed to learn on a single capillary. But in fact, I'm very proud of the 310. It is still in production 19 years after introduction. It has become the forensics platform of choice. It's used by crime labs and forensics organizations around the world primarily for STR genotyping.

It's a very robust platform, and I was once told that it's so straightforward, so robust, that even MDs can do research with it.

# Scaling to Multiple Capillaries and the 3700

Multiple capillary detection, again, Norm should be giving my talk, but here are the two publications that spurred us on to think about, okay, now we've done one capillary, we've got separation media, how do we go to a multiple capillary situation.

In 1997, we signed this deal with Hitachi to take advantage of their many, many years of instrument development process, but they told us that it would take them five years to develop a capillary sequencer. And in 1997, the world wasn't going to wait. In fact, I think Craig was already breathing down my neck.

And so we decided to embark on the 3700, which you all know and love. It uses that elegant sheath flow detection technology, which I just found out one of my coworkers said she never liked. But anyway, it's a good thing she told me 20 years later.

But the 3700 was meant to be an interim platform until Hitachi could come on board, because we certainly couldn't wait five years for them to develop a platform.

# Design Philosophy of the 3700

And in fact, some of the design principles reflect even then uncertainty in what the future of electrophoretic-based sequencing was going to look like. I was really enamored of a technique called gel-free electrophoresis which promised to do completely gel separations in very fast times. We were also experimenting with microchannel plates like Rich Matthais had done.

So the design philosophy was sort of thinking that maybe there are several different formats that we might want to go and not be completely enslaved to the capillary platform. Nevertheless, I thought the sheath flow technology was really cool, and it seemed to have done the job.

# Legacy of Sanger Sequencing Platforms

So I'm going to stay on time because people have already talked about most of the things that I wanted to address. Again, this is the arc of platforms, Sanger-based platforms that have come out of Applied Biosystems. It was a lot of fun to develop them.

I left DNA sequencing, capillary-based sequencing, in 1999 after the introduction of 3700. The product management at Thermo Fisher tells me that 30,000-some Sanger sequencing platforms were installed over this time frame. They won't give me the breakdown of each of the particular models because it's sort of trade secrets, but 30,000 platforms were shipped.

They tell me today, and this information is a week or two old, that approximately 15,000 of those are still in use. So Sanger sequencing in electrophoretic platforms still has a very strong role. In fact, they introduced this brand new platform in 2009. People are using those for diagnostics. People are using those for what is now popularly called targeted sequencing. People are using that for validation of variants that come from next generation sequencing.

But I guess I kind of knew we had shipped a large number of platforms, it felt like it, but hearing that number 30,000 was pretty awe-inspiring to me. And as I said the fact that the 310 is still being produced and shipped 19 years after we developed it is gratifying as a technology developer.

# Acknowledgments

And so then lastly, right on time, there's too many people for me to name. My colleagues at Applied Biosystems are rich, very rich set of individuals engineers scientists chemists very incredibly talented group of people to work with.

For those of you who don't know who have visited those that site it is no longer there. It's been razed to the ground. So there's just, that's quite amazing because I actually entered those buildings when they still had a dirt floor. They're gone. They're back to dirt. Such is life. It goes on.

And I would like to thank Mark Stevenson and Li-Shen Zhu at Thermo Fisher Scientific for giving me some of the slides and information.

Thanks, Bill.

# Q&A: BigDye Terminators and Compressions

**Question:** One of the effects of the BigDye terminators was that compressions were much easier to deal with. I mean, they sort of disappeared. When did, did you have any idea that was going to happen or when did that become apparent?

**Bill Efcavitch:** I don't believe that was a design feature. I'm sure it was completely serendipitous. I mean, there had been Seeburg published work that said if you went to dITPs or 7-deaza-dGTPs that you relieve some aspect of compression. So there's clearly a structural effect. And so I'm guessing just having that huge appendage out there banishes it. That was always our guess. Yeah. In fact, I mean, yeah, serendipity helps.

# Q&A: Reception of the 373 Sequencer and Training

**Question:** I've read somewhere that the reception of the first ABI sequencer, the 373 was not suspected, especially among the scientists who have been involved previously in manual sequencing, that there were some reservations about it. And I was wondering what role, if any, the marketing teams at Applied Biosystems have in doing, like, training courses and educating, making the product more attractive for the users.

**Bill Efcavitch:** That's actually interesting. I mean, I might have to defer to Cheryl on that question. I think it's like any new technology, and certainly there was a lot of change, but I mean, look, like any technology that gets introduced, it wasn't perfect when it was introduced. And there wasn't just the hardware element.

I think one of the big breakthroughs for sequencing in the early days was cycle sequencing. So yeah, there, Cheryl, do you have anything to...

**Cheryl (response):** Yeah, I guess I can add, so cycle sequencing certainly helped a lot. The early sequencing was just standard extension with Klenow, and the initial sites were almost all sequencing experts, and our protocol was considerably different than the radioactive dideoxy-Sanger sequencing protocol.

And I have to say that we did do some training, but people who were experts kind of wanted to follow protocols that they were comfortable with and familiar with and thought were probably better. And I can tell some interesting stories more about why our at least one aspect of our protocol that was different.

But the site that was the most successful was actually a site that did not have expertise, or so much expertise in DNA sequencing, and basically followed the protocol. And that's what actually worked. So, yeah.

**Bill Efcavitch:** That's well said. Yeah. There was always, even with the 3700, which was a couple generations later, there were site differences. Someone's sample prep was slightly tweaked relative to what we had done, and their performance was lower. It was hard to convince them of that.

# Q&A: Future of Capillary Sequencing

**Question (Han):** So Bill, thanks for the nice talk. Do you ever see the capillary sequencing come back?

**Bill Efcavitch:** I've moved on. I figure you're probably best person to say that. All right.

# LLM-extracted insights

- **Chemistry-Instrument Synergy**: Iterative coupling of organic chemistry (e.g., fluorophore optimization for polymerase selectivity) with instrumentation enabled rapid prototyping; virtual filtering via CCDs decoupled dye changes from hardware revisions.
- **Dye Excitation Uniformity**: Single-laser differential excitation solved via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in BigDye terminators, where an excitable "donor" dye transfers energy to spectrally distinct "acceptor" emitters, yielding balanced signals.
- **Terminator Workflow Efficiency**: Shift from four-reaction primer labeling to single-reaction dye terminators quadrupled sample prep throughput by eliminating lane-tracking errors.
- **Slab-to-Capillary Transition**: CCD simultaneous detection + gel cooling (>4x speed on 377); dynamic linear polymers like PDMA adsorb to silica, sieving ssDNA while suppressing EOF via altered zeta potential, avoiding static cross-linked gels.
- **Thixotropic Gels**: Novel PEG-fluorocarbon tails enable pressure-flowable "pseudo-gels" mimicking cross-links statically, though inferior to PDMA for resolution.
- **Serendipitous Benefits**: Bulky BigDye moieties sterically disrupt GC compressions (secondary structures impeding migration), echoing 7-deaza-dGTP effects.
- **Platform Scalability**: Single-capillary (310) prototyping informed 96/384-capillary arrays (3700); sheath-flow cuvette detection for mult capillary alignment; cycle sequencing (thermal cycling) simplified protocols vs. linear Klenow extension.
- **Commercial Robustness**: Academic ideas (e.g., Ward's modified nucleotides, Prober/Trainor terminators) ruggedized for 30k+ units, enduring in forensics/NGS validation due to reliability.
