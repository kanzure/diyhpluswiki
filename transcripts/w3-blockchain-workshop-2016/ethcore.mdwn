ethcore

At ethcore, we are building the infrastructure for the future of the decentralized web. Unless we get distracted by TheDAO and soft-forks and hard-forks. Maybe decentralization is not the most important thing. We want to build a p2p secure serverless web. Why is decentralization such an important notion? There's no intrinsic value in being decentralized. There's intrinsic value in being utilized and secure by people.

This is a bit of how we see the architecture. Blockchain is just one part of it. We also see a use of whisper and the UI part. This is where W3C gets comes in I guess? Transaction signing, identity management, so download ethcore and install parity, get the Chrome extension.

You download the node, you run the node on your computer, on ethereum you have your backend but you build your frontend application on your computer, maybe you don't see the URL right there, but it's localhost:8080 but we run many applications that creates a problem separating local storage. For now we use proxy back files and we go to the wallets... let's go to the transaction already, so over there, when you send the transactions, this is the moment where you have to use your private key stored on your node but they are password-protected. The app can ask you for the password. It might memorize the password. So what we build is a chrome extension that asks you for the password. This is the only place where you have to provide a password.

This was not meant to demo your product.

What is the browser's responsibility and the browser's role in this decentralized environment?
