LLM summary: Ed Boyden presents a vision for achieving [[whole brain emulation|brain emulation]] through integrated [[neurotechnologies|brain-computer interfaces]] that enable high-fidelity mapping, imaging, and control of brain dynamics at cellular and molecular scales, drawing analogies to physics' "ground truth" of fundamental particles enabling bottom-up engineering like microchips; he highlights scaling [[optogenetics]] via holographic projection for real-time control of every neuron in small brains (e.g., fish, worms), ultrafast light-sheet voltage imaging at 200 volumes/second in larval zebrafish using advanced indicators and remote refocusing to reveal microscope limitations over indicator blame, and [[expansion microscopy]] enhancements including multiplexed 20-nm resolution antibody imaging of mouse cortex synapses, controlled protein fragmentation for single-molecule structural mapping matching crystallography or ML predictions, and parallels to genome expansion-sequencing; these tools converge to generate connectomic-molecular maps supporting top-down network predictions, mechanism inference from dynamics, and purely bottom-up simulations for therapeutics, philosophy, and AI, with emerging prospects like index-matching for **transparent living mammalian brains**.

# Introduction

Yeah, so I'm Ed Boyden. I direct a group at MIT. It's great to see many old friends and great colleagues here.

And today I want to talk a little bit about some thoughts on technologies for mapping, imaging dynamics of, and controlling dynamics of the brain, and where they may synergize maybe in the short to medium term towards whole brain emulation.

# The Ground Truth Metaphor

So I guess one concept or maybe metaphor that I've been really obsessed with is this idea of the ground truth. What are the fundamental building blocks? And then how can we understand how they interact?

And the metaphor that inspires me a lot—I trained as a physicist—is this idea of if you have a description of, for example, in physics, the fundamental particles, and can see how they relate to each other, then you can start to do really bottom-up engineering. And so transistors, lasers, microchips, the list goes on and on.

And then you get examples where the science risk has been reduced to the point where, you know, there's still engineering risk and market risk and other kinds of risk, but the science risk is pretty solid.

And so an interesting question is, you know, is there a microchip moment for the brain? And what would it look like where design and de-risked engineering rule the day and the science risk of understanding what we're doing has been minimized?

# Group's Tools and Pipeline Vision

And so over the last 20 years, I run a group that's been building tools for controlling high-speed signals in the brain, recording those high-speed signals, and then trying to make maps of molecules and wires. And, of course, we've been mostly sharing these tools for other people to use.

And one question is, can we assemble these into a pipeline where perhaps we could integrate all of them and get the kind of data that would yield very ground-truth-oriented, bottom-up software simulations of the brain?

And I know there are many other ways to go after simulation. I don't claim this to be the only way of doing it. But the hope is that the sort of combinatorial explosion of possibility that bottom-up simulation allows could be very informative. For a variety of different arenas, including predicting therapeutic targets, maybe delving into philosophical explorations, and then, of course, of interest to many is AI.

# Scaling Optogenetics to Whole Brains

So a couple of tool sets we are now trying to figure out. How would you scale them up to whole brains? And what would that look like?

And so one tool set that we worked on for a very long time is optogenetics, where we use light to control brain cell activity. And then just as you bring electrodes into the brain, you can bring optical fibers in. You know, there are all these molecules from all over the tree of life that convert light into ion fluxes and therefore can be genetically installed in brain cells in order to turn them on or off.

We can then hyperpolarize cells by transporting positive charge out of a cell or negative charge into it, or we could activate a cell by bringing positive charge into it.

And so these are great for causal assessments, right? We can perturb something and see whether it's necessary or to some extent sufficient for a behavior or a process.

And so where we're at right now is thinking a lot about how do we take this concept of holographic optogenetics pioneered by people like Valentina Emiliani and scale it up to entire brains, starting with small brains.

And so one of the goals is maybe starting with small brains like those of fish and worms: could you be able to control every cell in real time with high-speed holographic projectors?

# High-Speed Voltage Imaging of Whole Brains

Basically, we're also very interested in the inverse problem of imaging all the neural activity—ideally at the level of voltage with single cell resolution—of entire brains and again the hope is to start small.

And so this is work that we're doing on trying to build very high speed light sheet microscopes taking advantage of advances in remote refocusing, technology, camera technology, and the like.

So we built a machine that can scan a sheet of light about 200 volumes per second, not frames per second, but could look through a larval zebrafish with about 100,000 or so neurons.

And these look like electrical traces, but they're not. We're imaging the voltage of them using the positron-2 molecule from GenEAL.

I think a lot of people in voltage imaging kind of blamed indicators for the poor quality of some voltage imaging experiments. But I think this result suggests that we should in the microscope part of the field also take some of the blame.

And the hope is that being able to record and maybe control entire brains with single-cell resolution is not too far off, at least for small brains.

# Expansion Microscopy: Multiplexed Imaging and Protein Mapping

Finally, we have this technique of [[expansion microscopy]], which you've heard a bit about already, where we take, effectively, baby diaper materials, synthesize them throughout specimens that preserve brain tissue—not living things.

And then if you do it just right you could add water and inflate them in an even or isotropic way. So we announced this discovery about 10 years ago that we could physically magnify objects.

Optogenetics and expansion are both in widespread use by thousands of research groups. But a couple of things today that I think are fun to point out are the ability to do multiplexed imaging.

So, for example, can we bring in many fluorescent antibodies one after the other and build up extraordinarily complex nanoscale pictures, far more than you could take a picture of on a single microscope frame? Here we have seen 20 antibodies with 20 nanometer resolution from the mouse cortex, and you can start to build up pictures of synapses, for example.

A sort of surprising plot twist, I think, happened here with some work that we did collaborating with the Labosilla-Rizzoli lab, which led the study.

But if you take a molecule, anchor it to the polymer, shatter the molecule into pieces, and pull the pieces apart, what you get looks awfully like the shape of that molecule.

And so here in gray are a bunch of proteins in their ground truth form, like crystallography. And then the false colored images are single, unaveraged, expanded proteins.

So is there ability to expand a biological specimen and just map all the molecules, matching them, for example, to their machine learning predictions, and be able to make a map of molecular content?

And this idea of controlled fragmentation has been kind of taking off. Another group, Jason Brunner's group at Harvard, did controlled fragmentation of the genome and then pulled the genome apart and sequenced it. Another beautiful paper earlier this year.

So there might be an emerging theme here of some kind of controlled fragmentation followed by some kind of sequencing-like event. You already heard about mapping connectomics from Andrew, leading E11 Bio.

And of course, the idea of putting the molecules in the context of the connectome is very helpful as a concept.

# Integrating Tools for Brain Modeling

And our hope, then, is to stitch all these together. So, for example, can we image and control (in blue) neural activity throughout entire brains, starting with small brains, (in yellow) make maps of molecules and wiring, and then make at least three kinds of models, you know,

top-down models where from network activity, can we predict more of it? Already many pioneering modelers have been doing work like that.

But maybe with the molecular information, can we infer physiology and underlying mechanisms from neural data of dynamical nature?

And finally, bottom-up prediction. Can we predict from molecules alone if we know what their functions are what neural circuits do?

# Future Directions: Transparent Living Brains

And then I think I'm out of time but we also very interested in whether we can make living mammalian brains more transparent. Expansion as I think we've been discussing could maybe scale up to whole brains because you can chop into pieces but can we raise their effective index of refraction and make living mammalian brains more transparent?

So there's a bioRxiv preprint if you want to take a look at this, but I think I'm out of time, so I won't talk about it further, and we'd love to discuss things afterwards. Thank you.

# Q&A

**Q:** Questions, comments? So what's your view on how important completeness of data is? Like if we have 300 neurons with 302 and axons, we're missing one of them. How detrimental is that? And how does that change as we scale to larger and larger systems?

**A:** Yeah, it's one of those questions where we don't have a full answer, of course. On the one hand, intuition and maybe some degree of clinical data would suggest that the brain is robust to some kinds of perturbation.

But there's also evidence from, starting with papers from over a decade ago from Yang Dan at Berkeley and Michael Brecht in Berlin, where if you stimulate one neuron in the whole rat brain with the right pattern, you can change the whole brain state.

So I think we don't know for sure the answer to your question. But I guess the way I've been thinking is as long as we build the tools—of course we can aim for perfection with the tools but you shouldn't wait until they're done—we can start applying them along the way and already many people have used these tools to make discoveries.

If we apply them and find out that a certain level of approximation is good enough for a certain predictive or other outcome, that's great.

We have time for one more. Serena, I'm coming to you.

**Q:** You can already start projecting if you can make living neurons more transparent. Could you also make them less transparent, for instance, have them express things like substantia nigra so that there's less of an activation of certain ones?

**A:** I think so, yeah. I think you can imagine expressing all sorts of colorimetric pigments. In this case, we were trying to sort of even out the path of light to make light pass through the mammalian brain more evenly. So that's what this was. But you can also imagine doing maybe the opposite would be even easier.

That'd be intriguing. Okay, thank you so much. Thank you.


# Intuition

- **Ground Truth Bottom-Up Paradigm**: Fundamental particles/wires/molecules as Lego blocks for de-risking science via combinatorial simulations, contrasting top-down phenomenology; key intuition: reduce science risk to enable engineering like transistors-to-chips.
- **Causal Perturbation via Optogenetics**: Light-gated ion channels (from tree of life) for millisecond-precision on/off/hyperpolarization; trick: holographic projection (à la Valentina Emiliani) scales to volumetric control of all cells in small brains without physical implants.
- **Voltage Imaging Revolution**: 200 Hz volumetric light-sheet microscopy with remote refocusing/cameras images ~100k zebrafish neurons as patch-clamp-like traces using advanced indicators (e.g., positron-2); insight: microscopes, not just dyes, bottleneck performance—hardware scales faster.
- **Expansion Microscopy (ExM) for Nanoscale Mapping**: Isotropic hydrogel swelling (diaper polymer trick) enables 20-nm multiplexed antibody imaging beyond single-frame limits; mechanistic innovation: controlled fragmentation/anchoring reconstructs single unaveraged protein structures, akin to cryo-EM, matching ML/crystallography for molecular connectomes.
- **Integration Pipeline**: Blue (dynamics control/imaging) + yellow (molecular/wiring maps) → hybrid models: top-down (predict activity), physiological inference, bottom-up (molecules → circuits); emerging theme: fragmentation + readout (e.g., genome ExM-seq, connectomics).
- **Robustness and Scalability**: Brains tolerate incompleteness (clinical intuition) but single-neuron perturbations alter states (Dan/Brecht); trick: deploy imperfect tools iteratively for discoveries without waiting for perfection.
- **Optical Tissue Engineering**: Index-matching pigments homogenize living brain light paths; reversible extension to opacity for selective control (e.g., melanin-like).

# Transcription errors

- "positron 2 molecule from genealia": Highly uncertain; best guess "Ace2N" or similar voltage indicator (e.g., from GenEA/Genie lineage or Boyden lab's "Maroon"/"Violet" series), but "positron-2" and "genealia" (possibly "GenEAL" or "Genie lab") do not match known names precisely—may be new/unpublished preprint sensor.
- "Valentina Miliani": Corrected to "Valentina Emiliani" (pioneer in holographic optogenetics).
- "Labosilla-Rizzoli": Uncertain collaborator/lab name; best guess "Lippincott-Schwartz lab" or "Rizzoli lab," but no exact match—possibly "Labella-Rizzoli" or transcription of "B. S. Rizzoli" or similar (recent ExM-protein paper lead?).
- "Jason Brun Roster's group": Corrected to "Jason Brunner's group" (Harvard, genome ExM-seq).
- "acetylgons": Clearly erroneous; contextually "axons" (connectivity completeness).
- "kinetomics": Clearly "connectomics."
- "E11": probably E11 Bio? possibly "Allen Institute," "Janelia," or "EM lab" abbreviation for Andrew's affiliation (connectomics leader).
- "index of saline": Clearly "index of refraction" (optical transparency).
- Minor: "remote refocusing, technology" → "remote refocusing technology"; "design and de-risked" → "de-risked design"; phrasing preserved word-for-word where clear, but technical terms standardized (e.g., "connectome," "holographic optogenetics").
