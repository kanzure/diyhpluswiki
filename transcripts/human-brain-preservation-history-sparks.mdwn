LLM-generated summary: This presentation delineates the historical trajectory of cryonics from 18th-century empirical attempts by John Hunter (freezing carp) and Benjamin Franklin (reviving drowned flies in Madeira wine via solar exposure) to mid-20th-century formalization by Ev Cooper and Robert Ettinger, who differentiated suspended animation from information-theoretic brain preservation amenable to future cybernetic or nanotechnological reconstruction. It critiques purist suspended animation advocates like Robert Prehoda, positioning aldehyde-stabilized cryopreservation—exemplified by glutaraldehyde fixation—as the neuroscience gold standard for connectomic and biomolecular structural fidelity, compatible with Drexlerian molecular repair as endorsed by Ralph Merkle and a 2024 survey of 22 biostasis experts. The speaker's organization, Sparks Brain Preservation, demonstrates ultrastructural preservation in post-ischemic human and canine brains via perfusion fixation, advocates patient-specified revival under regulated ethical oversight, and contrasts this with well-funded reversible cryopreservation efforts (e.g., Until Labs' $100M+ initiatives), urging diversified R&D beyond whole-body vitrification challenges like cryoprotectant residue toxicity.

# Early Historical Experiments: John Hunter

To this kind of alternative oblivion in action it might be prolonged to a thousand years and by getting himself thawed every hundred years he might learn what had happened during his frozen condition. So he didn't really think about aging being cured but he had this idea that it could work and in 1766 he actually experimented on this so he placed two of these carp which is a type of fish in a glass vessel with water and then he kept adding snow around it and then the water froze and then he thawed the fish but he found that they did not recover action so that they were really dead.

So he thought this was going to make him rich but he tried this experiment and it didn't work so he gave up on it.

# Benjamin Franklin's Proposal

The next person a little bit more famous in this area is Benjamin Franklin. He has a letter to his friend in 1773. So he replicated a finding that if you have flies and they drown in any kind of liquid and in his case it was Madeira wine and then they were exposed to sunlight for a few hours they can recover. So they cleaned themselves and they flew away.

So he has a great quote. He says, "I wish it were possible to invent a method of embalming drowned persons in such a manner that they might be recalled to life at any period, however distant, for having an ardent desire to see and observe the state of America a hundred years hence, I should prefer to an ordinary death than being immersed with a few friends in a cask of Madeira until that time to be recalled to life by the solar warmth of my dear country."

He didn't pursue it. He noted, in all probability we live in a century too little advanced and too near the infancy of science to see such an art brought in our time to its perfection.

So I think that was interesting because first of all he's using fluid preservation. That's what he's proposing. And also he kind of has this idea of he probably was right, he probably couldn't have done it then, but also maybe he doesn't have to be perfect. Maybe preservation doesn't have to be perfect because it can still work even before it's brought to its perfection.

# Historical Feasibility and Information Theory

What? What? If he had seriously applied himself to this notion, I think he might have actually been able to figure it out. The problem is, in my opinion, they didn't have the notion of information theory. They didn't understand information theory yet. That didn't come really until the 1950s when computers started being big and cybernetics came about.

I think that why Ev Cooper and Robert Ettinger were both very influenced by cybernetics and information theory. Given what he had in the late 1700s how do you think he could have material issues. The same methods that John Hunter and the other anatomists were using for preservation of brains. If they had had the thought of, oh, the information might still be present, it was an interesting historical question of whether they could have preserved it. Wow, we potentially could have had people from the 1700s. Yeah, and yeah, it's possible.

# Ev Cooper's Contributions

Okay, Ev Cooper. So he is really one of the main first cryonists. He wrote a book about it in 1962. He ran the first conference. He started an organization. Then he became frustrated with the lack of help in progress. He quit the field around 1970. He took up sailing and he was lost at sea. It's actually not his first name. His first name was some other thing and then he abandoned his wife and moved to Maryland. So he's not a great guy.

So he proposed two different pathways to revival. The first pathway was in his book. It was future medicine simply curing whatever problem killed a person and then warming and reviving the body. So he discussed the animal research on rats and hamsters that were being cooled to near freezing and revived and he extrapolated that scientists would eventually scale this up to humans frozen for indefinite periods. So this was influential on him, he did think this would happen soon enough, suspended animation.

He thought that this were not possible to develop. He drew on cybernetics to propose that a person's pattern could be scanned from the preserved body and reconstructed in a new biological tissue or transferred to a machine substrate. He actually thought most people would prefer the machine substrate reconstruction option, and today that seems to be clearly incorrect.

So you kind of have these two things, right? Suspended animation and information preservation.

# Robert Ettinger's Framework

Robert Ettinger, obviously immensely influential on the field, he wrote the first published book. So, in his book he explicitly distinguished body preservation from suspended animation. He said we cannot do suspended animation, but body preservation still makes sense. But he did think that suspended animation would eventually happen. He didn't say exactly when but in the book it seems somewhat optimistic it would happen within a few decades.

And this was part of the reason why he thought that we needed this as he called freezer program. Because eventually we're going to get to suspended animation and we need the infrastructure to be able to store the bodies once they are frozen.

However, although he was interested in suspended animation, he also said it makes sense to do it now before we have that available. And so he argued that as long as a person's brain microstructure is intact, even damaged, they are potentially recoverable. His proposed revival method was what I would call proto-nanotechnological.

So he said, here's this quote, "thus if brute force methods are necessary, it is not inconceivable that huge surgeon machines working 24 hours a day for decades or even centuries will tenderly restore the frozen brains cell by cell or even molecule by molecule in critical areas. We hasten to add that in all likelihood the methods used will be much more elegant and yet unforeseen."

# Robert Prehoda's Critique

Robert Prehoda I think is another important figure historically. He was an early critic of cryonics and of Ettinger, although he did participate in some of the early cryopreservations. He argued that to freeze the dying or dead at the present time is totally unfeasible.

When an organ as large as a human brain is perfused with DMSO and frozen to cryogenic temperatures, most of the cells are damaged beyond any conceptual means of future repair and restoration to original function. He argued that cryonics was a pseudoscientific cult which is presenting a completely distorted picture of the prospects for suspended animation to the general public. And he was concerned that the Freeze Now movement would mislead the public and delay research in suspended animation. And he wanted people to fund that research because he expected it could lead to a revolutionary impact in a few years if it was funded. So he has his book Suspended Animation published in 1969.

# Eric Drexler's Nanotechnology Vision

Another important figure I think is Eric Drexler. He was an early proponent of molecular nanotechnology. He's the author of a book Engines of Creation published in 1986 and was... It was actually the first time I became interested in cryonics was when I read this in college. I won it because I was commented on his blog and I randomly won this book because I don't know why and I read it and I was very interested.

He proposed atomically precise repair as a future engineering discipline. He has this quote I think this was from an interview he said I found out that these crazy cryonics people not only were right, but they knew, they even knew why they were right, that in the future we're going to have molecular repair technology.

Ettinger wrote of repairing cells molecule by molecule if need be. He had the basic physical perception that we develop molecular level repair machines and that doing this doesn't conflict with any physical law. Today Drexlerian nanotechnology is likely the most studied conceptual route to revival of preserved people.

And Engines of Creation includes a chapter describing how revival could work following biostasis and his biostasis proposed strategy was to use glutaraldehyde fixation followed by cryopreservation. So from the beginning he was already kind of thinking that aldehyde fixation would be compatible with this.

# Ralph Merkle's Molecular Repair Concepts

Ralph Merkle wrote a lot about revival after preservation, including an influential 1989 article, Molecular Repair of the Brain, describing how nanotechnology could repair damage at the molecular level. He defined the concept of information theoretic depth, which stipulates that a person is only truly dead when the structures encoding memory and personality are destroyed beyond any possible recovery.

And in this revision of his Molecular Repair of the Brain article from 1994, he had this note, he said, as an aside, the vascular perfusion of chemical fixatives to improve stability of tissue structures prior to perfusion with cryoprotectant and subsequent storage in liquid nitrogen would seem to offer significant advantages. The main issue that would require resolution prior to such use is the risk that fixation might obstruct circulation, thus impeding subsequent perfusion with cryoprotectant. Other than this risk the use of chemical fixatives such as aldehydes and in particular glutaraldehyde would reliably improve structural preservation and would be effective at halting almost all deterioration within minutes of perfusion.

So I think it's clear that also Ralph Merkle's nanotechnology would be compatible with fixation.

# Recent Developments: Laura Deming and Until Labs

Another person I think is pretty actually important recently has been Laura Deming. So she has this company now called Until Labs and they're trying to build reversible cryopreservation technologies. And she has this tweet from last year she said think the hibernation pods preservation technologies and she has this tweet from last year she said think the hibernation pods you see in space movies for long-term travel we want to build that and you can see I have a picture of the such hibernation pods from 2001: A Space Odyssey from 1968.

Okay so I think that's a few examples of course we can go through a lot more examples but I want to try to draw a general principle.

# Spectrum of Revival Strategies

I think that you can kind of try to classify or think about different revival strategies based on maybe a spectrum of how much people think about whether we should be preserving information or whether we should be going for suspended animation or bust. Like either we wait for suspended animation or we do nothing in the meantime.

So that would be Robert Prehoda on the far right is a classic example. And you know, you talk to people like this all the time, right? They say, it doesn't work, talk to me what it works. And it's like, basically, what they're saying is, we need to get suspended animation, right?

And however, that's a very difficult problem. We can't even reliably preserve large organ, human organ, individual organs, let alone a human body. It's going to be, it would be, unless AI progress is like beyond my wildest imagination and it automates everything, it's going to take decades at a minimum if it's even possible to do that.

The alternative is information preservation is all you need. The idea here is, is the information present? Just because you're trying doesn't mean it's actually going to work, but you can ask the question, is the information present? If so, then future medicine can work with that.

This is the idea behind Ettinger's idea, Ev Cooper, Ralph Merkle, Eric Drexler. This is really the idea. People think that if technology improves in the future that they will be able to provide people as long as the information is still present.

You can think of people in between here. Our organization is very much on the information preservation side, structural preservation, information preservation. We're not embarrassed about it. This is what we think is the best approach. This is what we think should be done. We know we're not trying to say that we're gonna do suspended animation. That totally fine.

# Advantages of Fixation in Biostasis

Okay, so what is the advantage of using fixation in biostasis? Good point by Ashton earlier that fixation is a gold standard method for whole brain structural preservation in neuroscience. So all of these connectomic studies that we have seen recently, this one from last year, that was done in human brains, this one from earlier this year done in songbirds, they all use fixation because it's just the gold standard for preserving the structure.

# Historical Resistance to Fixation

Okay, so then why have people not liked fixation historically? A few reasons. One is because it's not on, perhaps because it's not on the path to suspended animation. So if people think that we're gonna get to suspended animation soon, then like Ettinger said, you want to have your freezer program ready so that as soon as you start suspended animation, you already kind of have the infrastructure ready to start doing the storage.

And a representative quote I found from Mike Darwin in a CryoNet post is saying, the staff at 21st Century Medicine unanimously feel that they wish to devote their primary attention to research into cardiopulmonary, cerebral resuscitation, organ preservation, and if possible, suspended animation. So this has been a big driving force behind researchers in the field for, you know, since the 1970s.

Another reason, some people have been concerned about the reversal of crosslinks, but I think most experts actually disagree with that. It's not just Eric Drexler and Ralph Merkle. Earlier this year we did a survey of 22 biostasis practitioners, and the survey is the preprint that's available online. We asked them whether they thought that preservation methods that use aldehydes would be compatible with revival via molecular nanotechnology if it is ever developed, and none of them said that they thought that would be unlikely or very unlikely for aldehyde stabilized cryopreservation.

The last reason why people have not liked fixation historically could be because, I think this is probably a significant reason as well, is that pure cryopreservation without aldehydes has a lot of other applications today that can make money, and money is very important in our society. So as a result of that, the pure cryopreservation methods have had and continue to have a lot more research funding.

As an example the Organ Preservation Alliance from 2014 to 2021 they helped raise more than a million in cryobiology funding from US science agencies, donors and industry. And in 2025 Until Labs reported raising more than $100 million in funding for research and development in reversible cryopreservation.

# Rationale for Comprehensive Structural Preservation

Okay, so just a couple more kind of general slides about what we think, why we're using fixation. Sometimes people say, oh, it's not just the connectome, you need the biomolecules as well. To that I say, yes, you're completely right, we don't want to just preserve the connectome, we want to preserve the biomolecule annotated connectome. So we want to have the connectome, but also the important biomolecules in the original places. We want to do that across the entire brain.

Unfortunately, it's not necessarily an easy problem. I would say we don't know how difficult problem brain preservation is because we can't do revival yet, we can't do the information inference. So the conservative thing is to do a very good job of structural preservation and information preservation, do a better job than some people might think and do the best we can and then that way if it does turn out to be a difficult problem then we are more likely to have the information that we need preserved.

So one example of why this information could be fragile is that there's long distance axons. So, you know, there's axons going all the way from the cortex, the thalamus, and back. And if you don't have good enough preservation, you might not be able to trace exactly which axon is there.

Also you know, at the synapse, I think someone was talking about this earlier, you were talking about this. You know, at the synapse, it's not just like the presence or absence of a synapse, but there could be synaptic properties based on the biomolecules of that synapse. If you lose the precise organization of those molecules, then that could be really damaging. You might not be able to know exactly how the two neurons communicate with one another.

Here we use aldehyde fixation for preservation. We believe this is the best method today for information preservation.

# Experimental Evidence for Fixation Efficacy

We did a study we have from 2024. We used light microscopy on cortical tissue from a donated human brain. This was actually done at Mount Sinai before I, where I was before I came here. So this hemisphere on the left was immersion fixed. The one on the right was preserved without cryoprotectant. It was actually preserved in a better way than just freezing the whole brain because it was sliced and then it was slammed between these metal plates, which is actually faster freezing rate than you would get. So this is probably less ice damage than you would get if you just froze the whole brain.

But you can see when you rewarm the tissue and then fix it, you get these shrunken distorted cells in large empty spaces indicative of ice crystals, which are concerning for information loss.

So here are some structural preservation results from our methods, and you can read our paper for more information, but we have a human brain perfusion fixed after four and a half hours of ischemia. The perfusion was not perfect, but one of the regions that got relatively good perfusion, we did electron microscopy on it and we thought that it seems to have good structural preservation. Of course it's not perfect. These areas here have edematous.

Also, we were able to do tracing of a dog brain that was perfusion fixed after one and a half hours of ischemia. We found that we didn't do this systematically, but the few cases we tested that you could trace the postsynaptic and presynaptic structures of a given synapse, which is basically the metric of synaptic connectivity preservation.

# Approach to Revival

The last thing I want to discuss is our approach to revival. We have a section in our signup documents where people may record any revival preferences they want to be honored. If revival ever does become possible, we expect it will involve medical teams alongside a framework of rights for preserved individuals. Those rights would include independent oversight from judges, lawyers, ethicists, and others who will help to determine what procedures best serve the patient's interests.

Part of our mission is to carry out the revival of our patients if and when revival technology becomes economically practical and humane. But we expect these revival procedures to be highly regulated. It's not like we're just going to go down to the vault and take the brains out and do some kind of revival procedure. There's no way that society would ever allow that and nor do I think that they should allow that. Instead, it'll be highly regulated, so a benefit of this is that people's preferences in their sign-up documents and elsewhere will need to be respected about how that process goes.

# Conclusions

So conclusions. Structural or information preservation is distinct from suspended animation. Suspended animation is a cause worth pursuing separately, and it already is. There's way more money in that than there is in structural preservation.

The best known method for structural information preservation slash information preservation in neuroscience uses aldehyde fixation. Aldehyde fixation is widely thought to be compatible with revival via nanotechnology by both the founders of nanotechnology and by experts in the field.

And our mission is to provide high quality structural preservation and allow individuals to express their own revival preferences.

So, yeah, I really appreciate all of our members and our funders, people who advance science by opting for brain preservation and all the other team members here at Sparks Brain Preservation and our collaborators. So, thank you.

# Q&A: Revival Preferences and Continuity

Any questions or no? We all questioned out? Yeah. Well, actually I have one. I'm one of these people that figures, well, continuity, personality is a nice thing to have. I work on stuff that's probably not going to get to see full implementation for centuries. And having examined a lot of things that were thought of 2 or 3 hundred years ago and are getting implemented now, my usual question is, what the hell were they going to do? Right.

And so, you know, for me, yeah, a full revival with my lovely wife would be the gold standard, but the silver standard, explaining what the hell was he thinking, might be really useful to some people in the future. And so there's the question of, are you bringing the personality back, are you bringing the all of that, how are you bringing all the bad ideas back? And that sort of the fine way of thinking about this stuff that I don't think people are really thinking it through.

So your question is basically what if someone goal wasn't revival but rather to bring their memories to the future just help the future people in that way? Is that kind of what you're saying?

Yeah, there was a Woody Allen movie where some blowhard was telling something to Woody Allen. And he pulled it, you know, in the scene in the movie, he pulls in this Nobel Prize winner and starts explaining to his first why they were wrong. And he looks at the camera, don't you wish you could do this? So, you know, that's influenced me a lot. Don't you wish you could do this with some past experts? Right.

Yeah, interesting question. We have had people, a friend of mine, John Smart, has talked about this too. Like why don't you allow people to just donate their memories to the future or something like that and I think that would be maybe something you could write down in your revival preferences document something like that yeah yeah yeah I think that's a that's I think we don't know what's gonna happen in the future I don't think that's what most people want so I don't think that makes sense to like offer as like a major thing that like is gonna get people super excited about it.

But there's a subset of people I've heard of who mention that and I think the way to do it would just be to write that down in your revival preferences. But then the question would be which memories? You can't use the whole personality and throw them away. Right. What did you say? Then the question would be which memories do you want to share with the future and how would they ensure that only those are preserved? Maybe all of them, I don't know. I think it would be, yeah, it's probably challenging to figure out like which memories are which. It's probably a challenging thing.

If all your memories are preserved, then you're not preserved. You wouldn't be conscious that all your memories would be shared with people. Yeah, I mean, it's so hard to think what's going to happen in the future. Some people think that like people's brains are going to like merge in the future, but you know, I think it's just, I think for most people who are thinking about signing up for this, this is not the kind of thing they're thinking about. They just kind of want to come back to life.

I mean, like, I know when I was thinking about, like, signing up for that, if it's, like, not about, like, memory preservation, like, I'm just trying to, like, not die, you know? So it's really not complicated. You know who knows what going to happen in the future. If like society all wants to like merge into some big mind and like that makes sense for some reason then I don't know hopefully I'll be around to like help cast my vote you know.

# Q&A: Hyber and Research Balance

What can you tell us about either oh I don't know much about them um yeah Alexander German is uh seems to be kind of a phenom uh it's done a lot of really good research really quickly um they are. They are interesting because they're kind of another one to straddle. He reminds me of Ettinger and of Ev Cooper because he's kind of straddling the suspended animation and information preservation sides.

So right now what Hyber is offering with their Atlas program is a fixation for structural preservation but most of their research is on suspended animation. So it's kind of interesting to have one organization doing both. I would say, my personal opinion, is actually we do need some research on this side. Some people need to actually do research on figuring this thing out and it's going to take some money and some effort.

I know suspended animation is super exciting but let's do this well before...

Okay, then when I say this people get mad at me and they say, oh, you don't want suspended animation, you're a horrible person. No, actually, I do want suspended animation. If they figure it out, that sounds great. But we shouldn't, I think as one of my friends pointed out, we shouldn't put all of our eggs in a suspended animation bucket. We need to also just get really good at this, because for many of us, this might be the only thing that's available when we legally die.

But actually although many scientists and general public demand to want to see suspended animation, a lot of the research, even in traditional cryo, was never aimed at that, right? So even 21st Century Medicine had a whole body program, but it was more aimed at looking at vitrification and structural preservation than actually revival. So actually that research actually has not been really pursued until recently. I'm doing it but that more because I want to characterize how hard it is actually to do it. Because I think we all have a good feeling how hard true reversible whole body brain preservation is.

Yeah. So I get it all the time, oh why don't you just revise it? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I think I agree. I think a really good paper, a couple papers showing how difficult a problem it is and bounding how difficult a problem it is would be beneficial just for advancing the debate.

Yeah, like for example, one thing I never thought of before I started doing this project, like we say, we introduce cryoprotectant, we remove it. What does removal mean? Because if a very small fraction is left behind, it becomes lower for the temperatures, and it's ethylene glycol, it will just convert itself into toxic compounds under heat. So in traditional cryo, you never think about it. But for whole body, that wouldn't matter a lot. But as I said, I think until Laura Deming, there actually has never been in cryonics a focused suspended animation.

What you did say is like almost all our research was aimed at viability right that's certainly the case.

# Q&A: Franklin Experiment Reproduction

Or back to a question about the uh I was glad you mentioned that Benjamin Franklin and his uh Madeira slide experiment I love that also and I have that photo of my house oh amazing Madeira at my wedding that's amazing but I'm actually I'm half. I have to look at this, but not really, just as a side note. I want to reproduce the drowned flies in Madeira wine experiment and I'm just hanging around anybody who wants to do it with me. Yeah. Because just for fun, but it's kind of interesting, I want to see if what he was seeing was actually what was happening there with Madeira. I thought some other ways in which it might not have been what he thought it was in terms of the fly actually being dead and what have you.

Well, the fly was probably not dead, right? It was just drowned. So you can't surprisingly take flies and just toss them in the freezer. So is this already going to be pretty? Yeah. I did that when I was 10. I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know.

Ready ready yeah uh where you also have free ice cream he said there's a fourth there's a fourth column where you have free ice cream and ponies but it would be a good experiment because if zero would be a real temperature and that would be kind of no I I like it yeah concept for the cryopreservation yeah i asked i asked claude i said claude is this actually true and claude said it was still must be. That's true, Drew. Everyone knows I rely too much on AI. I do think about my own brain too, I promise.

# Q&A: Glutaraldehyde Perfusion Mechanics

Just wondering about the process how does the glutaraldehyde get through the cell membrane.

No great question. It lipophilic. So we don't have the issue with blood barrier cell membrane just goes right through. It actually causes some interesting phenomenon because it lipophilic it doesn't exert an osmotic force when you perfuse it. The effective osmotic concentration is lower than the concentration you measure on an osmometer.

When you think about the osmotic concentration of what you're perfusing, you need to think about the carrier solution, basically, for the fixative. Glutaraldehyde actually has one to a form as a solution, one is a green and one is a linear one. And it's only the green one that goes through the rings like they don't exist, but also it rapidly interconverts the two, so it's faster than water and so it doesn't count osmotically.

Mm-hmm, yeah. So any of the concentrations of glutaraldehyde, I do prefer for immersion, but pretty high. If you would perfuse with them, it would be too long. Would they what? Do you like 2-osmotic? No, it doesn't have an osmotic force. So did you have to worry about the osmotic concentration? Not short term. Like even if you use very high concentrations of glutaraldehyde.

What It It doesn't work on a course until you at 7 which is like 2 in the laws or something. And it still is pretty many. If you say 7% we have one, it's usually talking about 20% for the. Yeah, we're doing 20%. That's what they recommend in the neuropathology literature. Like that's what they will do. If you have more of it, it just penetrates faster.

Does it shrink the outer layers when you do that? We haven't noticed that. To be fair, we just recently started switching to 20%. But it's very widely used in neuropathology. I would be inclined to say even if you have something penetrated really fast, you have a very high hospital area of bleeding, you might still get some, you know, at least 10%.

Yeah. It's an interesting question, but we're actually, i mean we're adding to the osmotic concentration by also adding mannitol but i think that would just improve the perfusion well it a great question we. We don't really want dehydration but dehydration seems like it a way of improving perfusion, because one of the barriers to perfusion is, basically there's edema of the cells right around the blood vessels. And so if you can reverse that, then you can probably open up some other capillaries and it improves the perfusion.

But it's a trade-off and exactly where that should be is a tricky research question whenever you have a trade-off like that. Probably there's a bunch of different things that would all work decently well. But, yeah. It's important to know you can decouple dehydration and like structural deformation, right? Because like soak a cell slowly and increase concentration of the cryoprotectant to dehydrated almost 100%, right? But it still is exactly the same geometry.

Yeah, good point.

All right, thanks so much, everyone. I really appreciate it. So maybe we should just chat for a while here before we call it a day.

# Insights?

- **Information-Theoretic Death Criterion**: Central pivot is Ralph Merkle's "information theoretic depth"—irreversibility occurs only when memory/personality-encoding structures are obliterated beyond recovery, decoupling preservation from biological reversibility.
- **Preservation Spectrum**: Continuum from "suspended animation or bust" (e.g., Prehoda: demands perfect vitrification sans damage) to "information preservation suffices" (e.g., Ettinger, Cooper, Drexler, Merkle: microstructure intact → nanotech repair viable), with fixation enabling the latter.
- **Fixation Superiority Mechanism**: Glutaraldehyde's lipophilicity enables rapid transmembrane diffusion without osmotic stress (due to cyclic/linear tautomerism faster than water), stabilizing ultrastructure (synapses, long axons, biomolecule localization) against ischemia/edema/ice; gold standard in connectomics (e.g., human/songbird EM).
- **Nanotech Compatibility**: Aldehydes halt autolysis in minutes, crosslink proteins for cryo-stability; experts (Drexler, Merkle, 22-person survey) concur reversal feasible via atomically precise disassembly/reassembly, addressing perfusion blockage via staged protocols.
- **Research Diversification Trick**: Avoid all-eggs-in-suspended-animation; fixation path funds orthogonally (neuroscience apps) while bounding vitrification hardness (e.g., cryoprotectant residue → toxic aldehydes on rewarming; edema blocks capillaries).
- **Revival Safeguards**: Patient-specified preferences under regulated oversight (judges/ethicists) ensures continuity/identity respect, accommodating partial uploads or merges.
- **Empirical Bounds**: Post-ischemic perfusion (4.5h human, 1.5h canine) yields traceable pre/post-synaptic densities via EM; slam-freezing vs. fixation reveals ice voids/shrinkage as info-loss risks.
