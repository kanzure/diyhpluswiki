year: 2018

video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpC9HLqOLv4>

summary: Caruthers from the University of Colorado Boulder delivered an engaging historical and technical seminar tracing the evolution of nucleic acid synthesis, from the labor-intensive chlorophosphite methods of the 1970s—pioneered with his students Mark Matteucci and Serge Bukaj on controlled-pore-glass supports—to the transformative phosphoramidite chemistry that enabled rapid, high-yield solid-phase DNA oligonucleotide production, commercialized via Applied Biosystems's "Gene Machine" synthesizers in the early 1980s. He highlighted modern high-throughput ink-jet platforms with Agilent yielding millions of 150–300 nt sequences, innovative thiomorpholino RNA synthesis achieving unprecedented 166-mers, CRISPR guide-RNA enhancements via phosphonyl-acetate linkages for improved specificity, superior exon-skipping efficacy of all-thiomorpholino oligos in DMD models, and novel phosphoramid-imidate (P-N) backbones introducing positive charges for potential cellular uptake advantages, blending mechanistic cycles, yield modeling, biological data, practical tricks, commercialization anecdotes, and personal tributes to collaborators in a richly illustrated, anecdote-filled lecture.

# Introduction and Location

I reside at the University of Colorado, in the city of Boulder, Colorado, in this particular building, which is a new biotech building. We've been there maybe three years now, and this is a little bit dated because we've added another wing here on the north side. My office is on the fourth floor looking west, and this is my view from my office.

And here you can see the foothills, and then up here is the continental divide. These are the Arapaho peaks, and right here is an Arapaho glacier that's a permanent fixture of those peaks.

So this is where I live, and now to tell you what I'm going to talk about.

# Talk Outline

I want to start with some comments about the chemical synthesis of DNA, which is partially historical, and then new methods of RNA synthesis, and two or three slides on how we've been using RNA synthesis in the CRISPR-Cas system. Then I want to talk about some work we've done in developing a new oligonucleotide we call thiomorpholino oligonucleotides, some chemistry, a little biology, and then another new analog we call phosphoramidimidate DNA. And finally, if I have time, I'll talk about how we have used the chemistry to make this phosphoramidimidate DNA to also come up with a new method for making phosphoramidate DNA.

# DNA Synthesis: Modern Perception and Historical Credit

So, before I get started on the next slide, I want to comment that these days, when it comes to DNA synthesis, most of the young people in this audience, and you ask them who developed DNA synthesis chemistry, they think for a second, they say, well, probably Federal Express. Because when I want a piece of synthetic DNA, I type it on my computer, hit the return button and the next day Federal Express brings my DNA. So yeah it must have been Federal Express.

But that's really not what happened in my laboratory. The chemistry that we developed is shown here and the key individuals that developed this chemistry are Mark Matteucci as a graduate student and Serge Beaucage as a postdoc.

# Early Work at University of Colorado

Now, when I first joined the University of Colorado, I decided to work on a project called looking at protein DNA interactions. And we synthesized by older chemistries, the lac operator, cro and cI operators, and E. coli promoter. And we were very busy understanding how the cognate proteins interacted with these DNAs.

But three years later, about three years later, Mark came to my office and he was wanting to get a degree in organic chemistry. And I asked him why he came upstairs to see me after I was in the biochemistry division. And typical of the rebels in my group, he said, well, he said, there wasn't anybody's research in organic chemistry that I thought was very exciting. So I thought I'd come up and work with you.

So this is a beginning graduate student.

# Development of Chlorophosphite Chemistry on Supports

So, we sat down and came up with thinking about what Bob Letsinger had published two years previously using chlorophosphites to make nucleotides using P(III) chemistry. We decided that perhaps we could try to adapt this chemistry to polymer supports.

So, I talked to Bob Letsinger and asked him if he was planning to go that direction. I didn't want to impede on him if he happened to be going there. He said no, that he was going in different directions and encouraged us to get started trying to adapt this chemistry to polymer supports.

About that time, controlled-pore glass became available, not as a matrix for synthesis, but as a support for separating molecules on HPLC column. So Mark started learning how to adapt that controlled-pore glass for attachment of nucleosides to the support. And he learned how to do this, and he also learned how to attach chlorophosphites, and we published a couple of preliminary papers on this in Tetrahedron Letters, and then a summary of his work was published in 1981 in JACS.

# Anecdote: Mark Matteucci's European Bike Trip

A little side story about Mark as well is that he had this chemistry going and it was really looking good. 1978. He came in in May and said, well, I'm going to go to Europe and bike around Europe for the next three months. Oh, okay. So I bit my tongue, slapped him on the back and said, go to it. I knew that in those three months he'd have this whole project under control and he'd be out of there. He wanted to go to Europe and bike around Europe, so that was his choice. He came back and by Christmas he had his project completely under control.

# Development of Phosphoramidite Reagents

In 1978, Serge joined the lab. We were making DNA by using chlorophosphites. These reagents, you can't imagine building an instrument around them for making synthetic DNA. They have to be stored at minus 70 degrees, and the chemistry for making them is very difficult and challenging.

So we decided to see if we could figure out a way of taming this chemistry in a way that we could have reagents that you could synthesize and ship all over the world, and non-chemists could walk up to a machine and press a few buttons and make oligonucleotides. That was Serge's job.

We came up with a method of doing this, and that's this reagent here, which we call phosphoramidites. Serge learned how to synthesize these compounds, and then we can, using Mark's chemistry for putting oligonucleotides on supports, we combined these two and developed the pathway shown here, where we activate the phosphoramidite with tetrazole, condense it to a nucleoside, and a matter, well, I haven't met it here, it's shorter than that, and then acylate any unreacted hydroxyl groups with the acetic anhydride, oxidize P(III) to P(V). You need to do that because the next step is taking off the dimethoxytrityl group with acid, and if you leave it at the P(III) stage, it will get degraded by the acid.

So we oxidize, then we take off the acid, and then we're ready to go around the cycle again.

# Advantages of Phosphoramidite Chemistry

Now, when we first started developing this chemistry, we knew that we could make an oligonucleotide, we could make a condensation reaction in this cycle in three or four minutes maximum. But you have to realize in those days to add one nucleotide either by the triester or diester chemistry, that was hours, hours to do one condensation.

And so, you know, I initially when I started talking about this, I'd say, well, you know, it takes about a half hour to add a nucleotide because nobody would believe me if I told them it took less than five minutes. But after people started using this chemistry, it was obvious that this was a very fast way of producing DNA, and in fact the yields were always well above 95-98%, even in those days.

# Post-Synthesis Processing

So once we make a piece of DNA, we treat it with ammonia, and we're ready to do reverse phase HPLC with the trityl group on there and then treat with trichloroacetic acid, take off the trityl group. Many applications don't really require any purification, like if you're doing PCR or sequencing, etc. You can just make the DNA and use it if the yields are so good.

# Commercialization: Starting the Instrumentation Company

Now, in 1980, as Art mentioned, I got involved starting Amgen. At the first meeting in Thousand Oaks, in a little area that we decided to lease, we had a scientific advisory board meeting where we discussed what we were going to do in this new company. Lee Hood and I proposed we'd have an instrumentation division where we would build a DNA synthesizer based on this chemistry and a protein sequencer based on Lee's work at Caltech on sequencing proteins. The rest of the scientists said no, we really didn't want to go that direction. We wanted to have more of a therapeutic focus.

And so later on in the morning we had a break and the venture capitalists who were helping us start the company came up to Lee and I and said, well, you know, we know somebody at HP that would like to get involved in a new startup and would you guys like to start an instrumentation company around these technologies? This was Sam Eletr.

So we talked to Sam, and sure enough, we started the company (Applied biosystems). Sam hired two scientists from my lab, Bill Efcavitch as a postdoc and Kurt Becker as a technician to build DNA, to try to help develop an instrument. They took a piece of plywood, valves, little polyethylene tubing, a little column, nitrogen solvents, and started making DNA on a piece of plywood. Sam hired John Bridger from HP to build a DNA synthesizer.

Therefore we started this company Applied Biosystems in 1981 in April. By December of 1982, 18 months later roughly, Bill Efcavitch delivered their first commercial DNA synthesizer to my lab. That's the picture of Bill delivering it here. We wanted to do that before the end of the year simply so we could write in the annual report that we were shipping DNA synthesizers. Of course, we shipped one to a rather favorable place, in other words, my laboratory.

Then the next year they shipped out, I don't know, 30, 40, 50 machines. They were on their way. As you can see, Bill has started looking more like a businessman after about that time. So now in 2008, he actually looks like a businessman, not a scientist anymore. Kurt, of course, I don't have an early picture of him, but it's sort of like this.

# Anecdote: Gene Machine in Australia

Now, when I was traveling around, I gave a lecture at a meeting in Perth, Western Australia, and a visit to Fremantle, which is the port city there. There was this little shop called the Gene Machine. Of course they sold blue jeans, not DNA synthesizers. But in those days people called what these instruments that we built, they called them Gene Machines.

So I often used this, integrated this little picture into some of my early talks in those days that even in Perth, Western Australia they have a store called the Gene Machine.

Anyway, it worked out.

# Current Work: Long DNA Synthesis with Agilent

So this is what we developed. Let's see, my next slide. What are we doing these days. Well a few years ago now and the key reference is shown here Agilent approached me and suggested that they wanted to a lot of scientists had approached them about making long DNAs as they called them, DNAs that were longer than 100 in length.

So I got involved with them because I thought that would be an interesting challenge to interface our chemistry with an instrument to build DNA of longer length. So we adapted this chemistry to their technology which involved building DNA on a glass chip using a modified inkjet printer.

At each spot you'd deposit maybe 10 nanoliters of solvent as a phosphoramidite and then keep going back and forth just like when you print a page with ink and then at the end of the round you'd have one additional nucleotide on each spot.

Over the ensuing three or four years, Emily LeProust led this new synthesis-chip effort at Agilent. We now are able to synthesize simultaneously on 12 DNA chips per glass wafer, and each wafer is about six inches on a side. There are 12 chips on that wafer. Each chip contains 244,000 unique synthetic DNA sequences. In other words, about 3 million synthetic DNAs per glass wafer, simultaneously being synthesized.

On these machines, we can make oligonucleotides 150 to 300 in length, enough to do a lot of biology, and we control the synthesis through an inkjet printer that just runs back and forth.

So out there now at Santa Clara, they have about four or five of these machines. And they can synthesize the equivalent of several human genomes each day. And a human genome is about 3 billion base pairs. You can do the calculations of how many oligonucleotides that is. And these instruments operate 24-7. So there's a major demand for these compounds.

# Ink-Jet Synthesis Process and Gel Analysis

So let me show you where we are today. This slide shows you what I just told you. We coupled the DNA in a modified inkjet printer transfer it to a flow cell where we do the oxidation acid deblock and go around this cycle and make oligonucleotides up to 300 in length.

Now, this gel has good and bad news on it. The good news is you can see a band even at 300. The bad news is you see a lot of non-300 mers either above or below the band. And if we could eliminate these materials, we could really enhance this band and probably make oligonucleotides twice that length, 500-600 in length.

The good news, however, is that if you take this crude raw material and you do PCR amplification, none of the material above that band gets amplified, so it's damaged in such a way that you can't amplify it. And most of the material below the band does not get amplified as well.

However, here's where we are today. And this is a theoretical curve, and it shows the cold, hard facts of trying to go from 300 to 600. This graph here, all these are theoretical curves. This one here is this one, and that's if we have a 99.8% yield per cycle, and we have 0.06% side products. Then you get this curve, and maybe you'll get up to about 125 or so nucleotides in length, with a 10% yield.

If you reduce the side products from 0.06% to 0.006%, and still 99.8% yield per cycle, then you're at this curve here. So you can get up to 200, maybe 250, 300, and that's where we are today.

If you're at 99.8% without any side products, you're on this curve here. So the bottom line is, to go to longer oligonucleotides, we have to do two things. One is to increase the yield per cycle from 99.8% to something higher than that. Because here's the theoretical curve with no modifications whatsoever. And we also have to get rid of these side products in order to improve this yield as well.

# Historical Skepticism from Biologists

Now a couple of comments briefly. When we started this project DNA synthesis trying to develop a method, the biologists, the biochemists, the molecular biologists were not sitting around waiting anxiously for us to learn how to make DNA. Art mentioned the alanine tRNA synthesis.

And so we published that synthesis in 1971 as 13 papers completely filling one issue of the journal Nucleic Acids Research. And the reason we did that gene synthesis was because that was the first time anyone had ever learned how to make DNA of defined sequence with all four bases. And that was the reason. We wanted to do that so we could then start looking at biological systems. Because you can't look at many biological systems where you just make oligo-dT, for example.

So we published these papers, and here's what Nature had to say about it. This is a correspondent editorial in one of the Nature magazines. And the title was, Is Enough Too Much? The 13 articles from Khorana's group, which comprise a complete issue of the journal Nucleic Acids Research, surely set something of the record.

Every step, obviously, has been executed with consummate skill, and the whole constitutes perhaps the greatest tour de force organic and biochemist I've ever achieved. Well, if you know anything about Khorana, you know that that's all he does. He works way out at what you can do. Every project he'd ever attacked was a tour de force because it was so far out and he led other groups into following what he was doing. I agree with that part of it.

And then this correspondent goes on to say, like NASA with its Apollo program, Khorana's group has shown it can be done and both feats may well never be repeated. That's a nature correspondent. Sometimes, if I'm in England and I have an opportunity, I work this slide into my talk because if I see a nature correspondent or editor in the audience, I always like to zing them with this slide.

But it just wasn't at that time. Later on, I knew a fair amount of nucleic acid chemistry. In 1975, before we started developing the chemistry I just showed you, I was asked to summarize where we were with DNA synthesis at the 1975 nucleic acids Gordon conference.

So I went there and I spent my time summarizing where we were with nucleic acid chemistry. Then that night I was sitting around a table with several people and one person who is now a member of the National Academy, he looked at me and said, Marv, why in the world do you want to learn how to synthesize DNA?

He said, yeah, Khorana used it to make a gene and he used it to help solve the genetic code, but what else are you going to do with it? There aren't any applications. You're a bright guy, why don't you go do something else that's much more interesting. This is from somebody who's now a member of the US National Academy of Science. Of course, I'm not going to tell you his name.

That's the state of the art by molecular biologists, biologists and biochemists. They were not sitting around waiting for us to develop this chemistry. We were on our own. We didn't have anybody calling us up and saying, well, how are you coming? Do you have any further results? They couldn't care less.

# Transition to RNA Synthesis

So how much time do I have left? No, I don't want to do that. I think what I want to do quickly, well, I'll talk a little bit about this, but I want to get on to the thiomorpholino project.

We spent some time over the years developing various methods of synthesizing RNA, and this is our current method, state of the art. We're in this key part of this is using these thionyl morpholino carbamates as protecting groups on the 2-prime hydroxyl. This was done in collaboration with Doug Dellinger, and we published the paper here a few years ago. And Doug is at Agilent a former student in my lab too. He also a rebel.

We developed the chemistry. It essentially the same as what I just outlined for DNA synthesis except we have this thionomorpholidate carbamate as a protecting group. This wasn't the first chemistry we developed. We developed another previous one with Steve Scaringe, who went off and started Dharmacon. Many of you know about Dharmacon with that chemistry. Before that, there were several other protecting groups in the literature, but this one is by far the best.

We can synthesize, this shows the synthesis of an oligonucleotide, I think it's 166 long, some place on this slide it says that. I don't know, but anyway, it's about 166 long or so. The key event is that you use ethylenediamine to take off all the protecting groups and then do purification by HPLC. This is the product, this peak here.

So at 166, I think it is, you get maybe 15%, 20% yield. But I defy you to try to make this size with any other chemistry. You'll not get there. It's that simple. And this is the mass spec showing you that the compound is what we think it is.

So the neat thing about this is that it's a chemical method. And therefore, we can introduce modifications into RNA.

# RNA Modifications in CRISPR-Cas

And this shows some work done at Agilent recently. And I was not part of this study. It was published just earlier this year. And what they did is they used this compound, which is a 2-methoxy phosphonoacetate internucleotide linkage. And we developed this phosphonoacetate chemistry several years ago now.

But they put this analog at the 3-prime and the 5-prime ends as a nuclease inhibitor on the guide RNAs in a CRISPR-Cas system. It happened to be for a human beta-globin gene where there's beta thalassemia, etc.

Then they marched through the guide sequence part, putting one of these modifications per sequence at each and every site in the first 20 nucleotides, and asked how would this affect the target specificity because the focus here is to see if you can develop a guide sequence that has higher specificity for the proper sequence and lower specificity for the off sites. That was the focus of this particular study.

The answer is they found some. They found that if you march through this sequence one at a time and you compare the cleavage, this is an in vitro study, of the target sequence against the correct sequence versus the closest incorrect that gives the highest off-target cleavage.

This is the one without any modifications whatsoever, so you get this much of the correct sequence and this much of the off-site targeted one. But you march through putting one methylphosphonoformate derivative per guide sequence, you discover that there are certain sites, like 5 for example, where you still have pretty good targeting of the correct sequence but almost no off-site targeting. And this is the zero.

You march through and you find a few other sites. And they did this with several other genes as well. And in all the cases, you see pretty good specificity for this particular Site-5. And then there are some others as well. And that's an in vitro study.

So they did some in vivo work. And this is all published in this paper. And I'm just summarizing the highlights. I'm not giving you the details, because I want to move on.

And here they're doing some in vivo studies with this human beta-globin gene in various cell types, primary cells. And you can see here's with no modifications of this particular analog in the ribonucleotide guide sequence. And then if you look, if you put methylphosphonates at the 3-prime and the 5-prime end, this is what you see. And then if you put one methylphosphonoformate at the 5 position and continue to keep the methylphosphonates at the 3-prime and the 5-prime ends, here's the ratio of correct versus incorrect sequences.

And you can march through that, and you see that this one looks pretty good in three different cell types as shown here. So this is really interesting. There's no data that suggests this is the only modification, but it's clear that using chemically synthesized guide sequences you can introduce modifications that will selectively recognize the correct sequence.

And they argue in this paper that it's probably due because if you look at the placement of the sequence in the Cas protein, you'll see that what you're really probably doing is destabilizing to some extent the interaction of the guide sequence with the protein and complement in the DNA site. And therefore, you probably destabilize that interaction more in the off-target site where you have mismatched mutations, as opposed to the correct site.

So you reduce the off-target cutting just simply by partially reducing the stability of the duplex in the CRISPR-Cas system.

# Introduction to Thiomorpholino Oligonucleotides

So, well, I won't go into this. This just summarizes, I'm gonna move on to some other work, what I just said. Now, what I wanna do is turn to what we did with the thiomorpholino compounds.

Now, this is a new analog. The morpholino derivative that's been approved for a Duchenne muscular dystrophy syndrome and treatment is this dimethylaminomorpholino compound. And this was initially developed by James Summerton and has been used by Sarepta, as you all know.

What we learned to do is to make this particular derivative here, either as all-thiomorpholino with this thiophosphoryl linkage, or a mix and match of thiomorpholino and deoxynucleoside, either as a thiophosphate or phosphate derivative.

It looks like a simple change, but it involved completely different chemistries. And these are the individuals in the lab that are working on this project or have worked on it. Sebastjan has now left the lab.

# Thiomorpholino Synthesis Chemistry

So this is the chemistry, and it's sort of like the other phosphoramidite approaches in some respects. This is the chemistry converting a ribonucleoside into the morpholino derivative, and I won't go into that, that's published.

So then we condense that with a bis-diisopropylaminophosphine, form this particular diamidite, and then we activate this with acetyl tetrazole, usually, to form the P(III) derivative here is the P(III) level, and then we oxidize it with sulfur, sulfurizing agent, and that's shown here, to form the thiophosphoryl derivative, take off the trityl group, and then go around this cycle.

Second time around, we might use the same morpholino synthon or alternatively a standard phosphoramidite to introduce a normal nucleoside oxidized with aqueous iodine and go around the cycle. So we can mix and match these in several ways.

# Stability of Thiomorpholino Linkages

Several observations. We had to, with this chemistry, we had to look carefully to see if during the iodine oxidation, we desulfurized these compounds if we were making a chimera. And the answer is no, this is an NMR, zero and 16 hours later. You see no change in the phosphorus NMR.

And then we wanted to ask, when you take off this acid trityl group, do you also get desulfurization? And the answer is no. And you see no desulfurization for 30 minutes, and then you start to see some. But you see that this deprotection is 30 seconds, so that means we could potentially make a 60-mer without worrying about desulfurization of this thiomorpholino linkage.

So then at the end, we take off the protecting groups and purify the oligonucleotide. These are the kinds of results we get. I won't show too much chemistry, but this is a mass spec analysis of the compound shown here.

A comment on nomenclature that I'm going to show in the next few slides. When you see an uppercase blue colored symbol, that's a morpholino derivative. Then the star is a thiophosphoryl linkage. And FL, of course, is the fluorescein label. And later on I will show some oligonucleotides where there's a lowercase black colored symbol and that the normal deoxynucleoside. And again with a star so that the thiophosphoryl linkage. But here we are here the UV absorbance, this is an LC-MS pattern, and then here's the total ion chromatogram of this material.

So then you take, I think it's about 40 scans in this major peak, and you look at the extracted ion chromatogram of this peak, and you can see the minus 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ions of this particular oligonucleotide here. There are a few small bands down here, but those are non-oligonucleotide. They have a charge of minus 1, and they're not oligonucleotide, these little bands in here.

# Thiomorpholino Biology: Exon Skipping in DMD

So, let me tell you about some results that I'm quite excited about. And this is a collaboration with, well I'll show that on the next slide. But what we're looking at here is exon skipping of exon 23 in the dystrophin mRNA. And most everybody in this building knows what we're talking about here.

And if you can exon skip 23, you can produce a functional dystrophin protein. And if you don't, you get a non-functional protein if it's mutated. And of course there are several other exons that have modifications in them that also lead to a deficient dystrophin. But we're looking at 23 here.

And in the literature, Mann published a walk through this region between the 3' end of exon 23 and the 5' end of intron 23 using 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate DNAs. And he observed that this oligonucleotide that slightly spans the exon region and most in the intron region gave the best results in terms of exon skipping. So this is the sequence that we focused on.

And this is a collaboration with Rakesh Vidu in Murdoch University at Perth Western Australia. And we haven't published this data. So we sent him four thio-morpholino compounds, as shown here. And remember, I told you that the upper case blue, that's morpholino, the lower case black is the deoxynucleoside.

So we synthesized these compounds and shipped them off to Rakesh and had him carry out experiments in this dystrophin model that I just told you about.

And these are some of the results. So we used two controls. One is an oligonucleotide and that's this one here. Deoxyribonucleotides 2'-O-methyl-thiophosphoryl, i.e. the same compound he, Mann, used to define this system. And then we used the PMO control, which is the phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer compound that Summerton developed.

Now I want to qualify this by saying we just used the PMO oligo. Recently Sarepta and others have started decorating this compound with various cationic compounds to get better uptake but we didn't do that, we just used this compound so the results with this compound and this assay are not very good but I don't want you to think that there aren't better ways of doing this with this PMO derivative.

But I want to focus on what we get as results with these four thiomorpholino compounds. First of all, the control, which is this 2-prime methoxy phosphorothioate that Mann developed. And here's the PCR. We treat with 24 hours with lipofectamine, each of these oligonucleotides in this cell culture. And we go at 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 nanomolar, not micromolar, nanomolar.

And with the 2-prime methyl phosphorothioate, this is the band that gets PCR amplified, the total band. And then if you take out exon 23, you get this series of bands here. And then there's some skipping of both 22 and 23, and that's this band here.

So you can see that with the 2-prime-O-methyl phosphorothioate, you get considerable exon skipping at the higher concentrations and some at the lower. And that's the same with 1147, 53, and 54, the ones that are mix and matches of deoxy and thiomorpholino.

However this compound here, which is all thiomorpholino, is the real winner. And that shown here you can see that even at the lowest concentration and that 5 nanomolar you get considerable exon skipping in this assay. And certainly as you go to higher concentrations, there's nothing left of the original transcript. Pretty good results.

# Exon Skipping Quantification and Cell Viability

Now, the next slide is a summary of what I just told you when you scanned this gel pattern. I'll just focus on the control 2-prime-O-methyl thiophosphoryl compound and our best result.

If you scan this, you see that 21% of the total scan is the correct exon skip product at 5 nanomolar and 4% is the 22-23 exon skip product. And then at 10 nanomolar, well that's 25% total. And then at 10 nanomolar, it's 38%, as you'd expect. It goes up.

And look at the best result we have with these thiomorpholinos. This is at 5 nanomolar, and you see 56% of the total material that gets amplified has already been exon skipped, either as the 23 exon or the 22-23. And then at 10 nanomolar, you see you're up to 68% already. So we're pretty excited about this result.

So we next, oh, I must not have hit it hard enough. OK, we looked at cell viability. And Rakesh tells me that there's no toxicity in these experiments. This was treated with lipofectamine 24 hours with our oligonucleotides. Lipofectamine usually gives some cell morbidity, but this is OK, according to Rakesh.

# Lipid-Free Exon Skipping

Now, then we pushed this envelope. We looked at transfection without lipid, no lipid at all in this sample. We just take the oligonucleotides, add them to the cell culture, and in this case, we wait five days. And then we do the assay.

And here's the phosphorothioate 2' methoxy control. You see maybe at the highest concentration a little bit of exon skipping, although you don't see any at the highest. So it's indeterminate in some ways.

However, the all-thiomorpholino is again a winner. You see exon skipping taking place at the 25 and 150 nanomolar after five days. No lipid. Just add the oligonucleotide to the cell culture and see what happens. And so I'm really kind of excited about this, as you would expect.

# Implications for Nuclear Activity

Now, what I'm really excited about is that, as you all know from your undergraduate biochemistry textbooks, maturation of messenger RNA is a nuclear event. It's not cytoplasmic. So that means that this activity is in the nucleus.

So we can imagine attacking looking at non-coding RNA problems. You can imagine looking at maturation of the microRNA steps that take place in the nucleus. You can look at maybe even epigenetic modifications. You can imagine using this kind of an oligonucleotide analog to look at all types of nuclear events in a cell.

# Cytoplasmic Assay: miRNA Inhibition

Now we've also done some experiments in the cytoplasm. This is a standard stably integrated plasmid in HeLa cells. And what we do here is the stably integrated plasmid has two luciferase genes. One is the firefly luciferase, which is constitutive and always on, so that's our background measurement.

The other one is Renilla, which has 15 binding sites for microRNA in the three prime terminus of the gene. So when that is under just normal control, you get the RISC complex binding with the microRNA in degrading RNA, and you see no luciferase activity.

However, you put an antagomir in there, which binds to the microRNA, then the RISC complex does not bind, and you get luminescence because you get expression. That's the assay.

So we then took these four compounds again and we looked in this assay of course a different sequence and here we see that the alternating thiomorpholino gave us the best activity in this assay and the others less so.

Here's the hairpin control that you buy from Dharmacon, which is the background control for all these experiments. So this particular oligo is outperforming the standard hairpin Dharmacon. They call it the miRidian hairpin inhibitor.

So we went to lower concentrations with this one particular oligonucleotide from one micromolar all the way down to one nanomolar. And even at one nanomolar, we see a little bit of activity in this assay for our thio-morpholino compound, the chimera, as shown here.

So it looks like these compounds are fairly active, not only in cytoplasmic assays, but also in nuclear assays as well.

# Thiomorpholino Summary and Team

And this is a summary of what I just told you. This is Rakesh and Boutree Lee, who works with him, and then Subhashish, who left my lab last summer, and then Hira and Katya, who have picked up this project.

So we're now up and running. Katya has made some more oligonucleotides for Rakesh, and so we've got this project back on go, and we're busy involved in looking for and in starting other collaborations and other systems to see what we can do with this particular analog.

# Introduction to Phosphoramidimidate DNA

I'll just mention a little bit about this amidimidate, because I'm sure I'm out of time. This is probably, well, it is without a doubt, one of the two most difficult analogs we've ever made.

This is a project that Ayman Al-Awaineh pursued in the lab, and that was to put nitrogen at both non-bonding positions in an oligonucleotide. We had done some work previously, Kirsten and Rato, in the lab where we had made dinucleotides using amidimidates and published them some time ago.

But if you look at this chemistry, you see that you can make oligonucleotides using this chemistry. But it gave us some clues as to what to look out for in terms of problems.

So Ayman tackled this problem. And this is not the first approach we tried, but it's the one that works. After a lot of work, he came up with this approach.

Now, I'm not going to go through the chemistry very much, but I want to tell you that the synthon that works is this one here, where we have phenoxyacetylamide derivative attached to phosphorus to protect one of the nitrogens, and then the bis-diisopropyl amino phosphorus linkage as the activated part of the molecule.

So we use this synthon to incorporate the protected, the phenoxyacetylamide protected internucleotide linkage after oxidation with iodine to form the imidamidate derivative. And then at the end of the synthesis, we take this off with ammonia and take off the trityl group, and then we're ready to go.

So the key synthon here was this particular derivative here that allowed us to have an open door toward making these amidimidates.

# Phosphoramidimidate Properties: Charge Confirmation

I'll just go on from here. Let me tell you, I mentioned, or I should say here first, the first clue is the fact, I keep showing this compound is positively charged. And the first clue was when we did a mass spec. Because to get the mass properly fixed, we had to add nine hydrogens to an oligonucleotide that had nine amidimidates in it, suggesting that there's a proton on each one of these internucleotide linkages.

So we then did an experiment where we used an oligonucleotide 12-mer as a control and without any modification. Of course, that has 11 negative charges. And then we inserted three phosphoramidate linkages into the same sequence. And that means that you have a net minus eight charges because this linkage is neutral.

Then we put three imidate linkages in the same sequence at the same spot. And if this is positively charged, then these positively charged will neutralize three negatively charged phosphates. And that means we have a net of minus eight? Wait, net minus five? These compounds all have basically the same molecular weight.

Therefore you would predict that this unmodified compound would move the farthest on a gel which it does. This one next, because it's got eight negative charges, and the least mobile would be this oligonucleotide containing three positive and eight negative charges? Wait, the gel pretty much confirms that in fact we do have a positive charge on this nitrogen.

# Duplex Stability and Zwitterion Effects

I'll just tell you what this tells us, and it was a disappointment to me initially, but now I think I understand what we can do next. I thought putting this positive charge in this oligonucleotide would be like sodium chloride. It would interact with the phosphate groups on the complementary strand, and we'd have a duplex that would be really, really stable.

Well, it turns out that's not the case. In all cases, we've looked at the complex of normal DNA or RNA with this oligonucleotide with phosphoramidimidates in it is less stable. Well, that was kind of a disappointment.

But in retrospect, you're looking at two competing zwitter ions. One is a single strand where these positive charges are interacting with the negative charges on the same oligonucleotide. And you're also looking at a zwitterion where the positive charges are interacting with the complementary phosphates on the other strand. And the single strand zwitterion wins out, and you get a less stable duplex. That's, I think, what's going on here.

And these oligonucleotides down here were made where Ayman had half the oligonucleotide linkages positively charged amidimidates and half negatively charged phosphates. And if you model it, there's a phosphate and then an amidimidate positive charge right next to one another on the opposite strands.

So I thought this would be a super, super stable zwitterion, you know, but you've got these. But it turns out it's less stable than any of them. Again, for the same reason, I think it's competing.

So the obvious next step is to make an all positively charged oligonucleotide. Ayman made one and it was clearly made it, but we have absolutely no idea how to purify the compound. It's all cationic oligonucleotide.

# Future Directions for Phosphoramidimidate

The next person on this project's first job is going to be to try to figure out how to purify an all-positively charged oligonucleotide, because I think then, if one of these is all positively charged and you're complementing with a negatively charged RNA or DNA, you're going to have a very stable duplex. It won't be competing.

So that's where we're going with this project. And it turns out these compounds are RNase active. And that's what this tells you. And they are taken up by cells.

And when you look at a HeLa cell, in this, you have put a fluoride-labeled oligonucleotide with this many imidamidates in it. And you see these little compacted structures in the cell, cytoplasm, none in the nucleus.

We don't know whether, we haven't done any biology yet, so we don't know whether these samples will escape into the cytoplasm. We haven't done any biology yet, or whether they're in there coalesced and they're not going to be biologically active. So that's where we are with this project.

# Personal Acknowledgements and Reflections

Okay so I continue on I not going to talk about that. And there's my summary which I won't talk about.

You know this is a small collage of people that have worked with me over the years and I just wanted to thank them. It just happened to be a collection of pictures in my files, and it isn't everyone by any means, but I just found these. And there are a lot of people in here I'd love to talk about.

I could mention Alice, who worked with me for 29 years as a secretary. And I often said, well, you know, when Alice retires, I retire. I'm still going, and she retired about 10 years ago.

So and then I haven't talked. The initial project in the lab was spearheaded by Dave Golder and Dan Yansura. They both left my lab and became two of the first four scientists that were hired by Genentech. And they're responsible for working with Keiichi Itakura and Art Riggs at City of Hope. They cloned and expressed the human insulin the human growth hormone all the interferons that Genentech did etc etc.

And for his work at Genentech Dave became a member of the US National Academy in the mid. He then went on to start Tercica with a couple other Genentech scientists, sold that company to Amgen, and now he's a venture capitalist. And Dan is running one of the molecular biology departments at Genentech but I haven't talked about them and maybe I should just stop at this.

# Symposium and Personal Stories

I'll mention a couple of other slides my group, spearheaded by this young lady here put together a symposium in my honor quite a few years ago now organized by Carol Winston. And attending that three-day symposium were essentially all the students that had worked in my lab over the time I was there.

And this photograph here shows Betsy Hoffmann at Brandeis University, and there's Bob Letsinger, who attended and Jenny my now wife and me in this picture. And Jenny died about 12 years ago now. And so this was taken 15 years ago maybe.

Now, later on, I had a tendency. I didn't want to go to graduations, because I didn't want to hood my students. And they all knew that. So of course, the first thing they did was ask me to go to graduations and hood them.

Here's a picture of Bill at a hooding ceremony, Bill Marshall. On this particular photograph, two of my students, Peter Seberger and Darla Graf, had just graduated and they were being hooded. Here's a picture of Peter these days and there's another picture of Darla over here.

At that time, Fiona was looking around for her mentor, Art Riggs, and couldn't find him. So I said, well, why don't you join us, and I'll take care of hooding you, you know, because she'd gotten her PhD with Art. So this is a picture of Fiona with Darla and Peter, and there's me.

Well, it turns out after Jenny died a couple years later, Fiona and I got married, so... It's sort of an amusing little story.

So anyway, thank you very much for listening, and let's go with that.

# Intuitions, Mechanistic Insights, and Tricks

| Topic | Insight / Mechanistic Detail | Practical Trick |
|-------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| **Phosphoramidite chemistry** | Tetrazole creates a highly reactive phosphite anion; rapid coupling relies on high nucleophilicity of the 5′‑OH. | Maintain **dry, -70 °C** storage for phosphoramidites; use **capped reagents** to arrest side reactions. |
| **Ink‑jet synthesis** | Each droplet deposits a precise amount of phosphoramidite; back‑and‑forth flow allows stepwise chain elongation on a solid surface. | **Calibrate droplet volume** (≈10 pL) to avoid over‑loading and minimize side‑product generation. |
| **Thiomorpholino synthesis** | Thionyl‑morpholino carbamate protects the 2′‑OH while introducing a **thiophosphate** linkage that resists nucleases. | **Ethylenediamine deprotection** efficiently strips all protecting groups in a single step before HPLC purification. |
| **CRISPR guide‑RNA modifications** | Placement of **phosphonyl‑acetate** at termini subtly reduces duplex stability, preferentially destabilizing mismatched off‑targets. | **Systematically scan** each position of the 20‑nt guide; identify positions (e.g., 5) where modification yields maximal specificity. |
| **Phosphoramid‑imidate (P‑N) backbone** | Positive amidate charges generate *intramolecular* zwitterions that compete with inter‑strand pairing, decreasing duplex Tm. | **Mix neutral and charged linkages** to fine‑tune overall charge and solubility; avoid fully cationic sequences until purification methods are established. |
| **High‑yield coupling** | Achieving **>99.8 %** per cycle is crucial for > 300 nt synthesis; side‑product fraction must be pushed below **0.006 %** to reach 250–300 nt. | **Implement real‑time monitoring** (e.g., UV of DMT cation) to detect incomplete couplings and invoke capping immediately. |
| **Exon‑skipping assays** | Thiomorpholino oligos display *nanomolar* efficacy without transfection reagents, indicating favorable **cellular uptake** and **nuclear localization**. | Use **lipofectamine‐free** incubation for initial screening to assess inherent delivery capability. |
| **Purification of cationic oligomers** | Conventional ion‑exchange chromatography fails for positive backbones; need alternative methods (e.g., **hydrophobic interaction**, **reverse‑phase with ion‑pairing**, or **size‑exclusion**). | Explore **solid‑phase extraction (SPE)** with acidic eluents to neutralize positive charges before analysis. |
