LLM-generated summary:  Tom Benson of Mitrix Bio presented on bioreactor-grown autologous mitochondrial transplantation as a strategy for biological age reversal and disease treatment, emphasizing mitochondria's role in energy production and aging via mtDNA degradation; he detailed natural intercellular mitochondrial transfer via extracellular vesicles ("mitelets") from platelets, methods to culture and purify youthful mitochondria from patient stem cells, preclinical successes in enhancing sepsis/viral resistance, immune function, and optic nerve health in aged mice, and plans for Phase 1 human trials in 70-80+ volunteers targeting 130-year lifespans through periodic infusions equivalent to replacing 2-10% of cellular mitochondria. Q&A addressed purification akin to oogenesis, immune compatibility, dosing, and synergies with epigenetic reprogramming. Johnny Adams followed with advocacy for young donor plasma replacement therapy, highlighting its delivery of balanced youth-associated factors (exosomes, cytokines, GDF-11, miRNAs, mitochondria) superior to isolated interventions, supported by parabiosis data and clinical anecdotes, positioning it as an accessible bridge to advanced rejuvenation like Yamanaka factors.

# Meeting Introduction

Well, welcome to our GRG online meeting. I'm Johnny Adams. Today is Saturday, June 1st, 2024. And our speaker today is Tom Benson. Tom's the founder of Mitrix. And Mitrix and Tom are doing some really exciting things in biological age reversal and with mitochondria. So having said that, short and sweet, Tom, I'll turn it over to you.

# Mitrix Overview and Goals

Well, thank you. I appreciate it. And thank you for that professional introduction. So yeah, I'm happy to be here. I was going to give you our introductory, kind of our introduction to what we're doing and talking a little about some of the things that have happened recently as well. There's some people here who actually I've worked with quite a bit already, and there's a bunch of new people. So for those of you who've already seen this, you could just listen to the parts you want.

Let me start by bringing up a screen here. All righty. Everybody can see the screen. I can. Okay.

So, yes, what we are aiming to do is, and what we are doing is reversing age and also potentially curing a great number of diseases using bioreactor-grown mitochondria that are transplanted into the body. That sounds a little bit like science fiction. It's new, but it's actually a very, very hot field right now. It's research going on at universities all over the world. It's about a 10-year-old concept first developed some time ago, and it is really gaining speed because it has a lot of potential benefit medically.

So let me just explain to you, first of all I just want to say this is pretty experimental stuff. We typically when we're working with volunteers and people we typically work with people who are technically savvy. But please don't go out and try to do this on yourself because it is scientifically complex.

I also want to say we have a very, very good team. We've been around for about three and a half years now. We've got some of the best scientists in the world. A couple of people from Stanford and UCLA as our advisors who you probably recognize. Tom Rando is very well known as an aging expert. And then we have people from various universities, all of whom really are mitochondrial experts in their own right.

And what happened was that a few years ago, I basically started contacting these people and said, hey, let's put together a North American team to go after this. And I also want to say that the goal which is now being expressed in this new project that we just launched a few weeks ago, the big goal is to be able to do full age reversal of the body.

Somebody is not muted. Yeah, okay good, thank you. Um, everyone mute your microphone please. I was muted already so I'll mute again.

We're aiming eventually and very soon now we're aiming to do to get people to 130 year lifespan. That's the big goal. And we have a team now of 15 or 16 volunteers, most of whom are in their 70s and 80s who want to be part of this expedition.

# Mitochondria Fundamentals and Aging

Okay but let me back up now and tell you what this where this comes from. So the analogy we always use is let's say that you know you're looking at this is actually my Toyota minivan it's actually much uglier than this now that's a few years ago it's the paint's peeling and so forth and the if anybody's ever had one of these, they know it just, the engine just never dies. It keeps going and going and going. We've had this thing 25 years. The kids have smashed into things with their learning to drive and it's been taken on a thousand vacations.

But the one thing that I learned years ago was that every four years the battery goes bad. Okay. And so you have to take it to the shop and give them their and they pop out the old battery and they put in a new battery. And then you get more.

So our philosophy with mitochondria is, what if we could replace your mitochondria the way that you replace the battery in a car? Which again, sounds like science fiction, but as it turns out, based on this work that we've been doing that has been done by many, many researchers all over the world. The research is showing that in fact, mitochondria are extremely replaceable, as it turns out.

They don't just sit in the cells and just sit inside the cells. Mitochondria are constantly transferring around your body. They're being moved around. They're transferring themselves. They go between cells, actually go through the walls of the cell. They go through most of the membranes that we've ever tested in the body. They are carried by extracellular vesicles in your blood.

Every one of you right now has almost a trillion mitochondria in your bloodstream contained in the platelets. Okay. You have a hundred billion platelets. Actually, you have more than 100 billion. You have a few trillion platelets. Every one of your platelets has five mitochondria in it. And when that platelet gets to the end of its lifespan, it donates those mitochondria to other tissues.

So your bloodstream right now is absolutely packed with mitochondria being transplanted.

By the way, for people who forgot what a mitochondrion is, the mitochondria are the little organelles that you have inside each of your cells. They generate all the energy. Without them, if your mitochondria were to just all stop right now, you'd be a puddle of goo on the floor. There is no life without mitochondria.

All of your brain, all of your thoughts are being maintained by mitochondria that are constantly working and generating energy. Everything that happens in your cell is based on this mitochondria. You have about 100 per cell and you have five mitochondrial DNA per mitochondrion.

# Mitochondrial DNA Damage and Decline

And I'm about to show you what a mitochondrial DNA looks like. But just so you know the point of all this is that as we age according to all the research we're looking at our mitochondria decline. We start with perfect mitochondria when we're an egg, and it's all downhill until we get to be 85, 90, 95 years old. And then the mitochondria give out, assuming we haven't gone and gotten ourselves killed in some other way.

The mitochondria give out and we start to just, we run out of energy. Cells can't do their jobs. And there's all these age-related diseases that crop up even before that based on the loss of mitochondrial energy. And we'll talk a little bit about this. Most age-related diseases now are either caused by or they have some influence from the mitochondrial decline. Okay, that is what most researchers believe.

And I want to repeat again, all of this is new. It's very theoretical. This is the work that we've done. You're going to find lots of people out there in the world, including other mitochondrial experts who will disagree with many of these things that I'm going to say. This is our working hypothesis, which has been quite good. It's been very successful. So we're pretty happy with it.

So this is a picture of mitochondrial DNA. It's actually a picture of about 500 strands of mitochondrial DNA that we got from a urine sample. This actually happens to be from my mother, okay who is now 95 and in great shape um and was kind enough to donate for her son's crazy project.

And uh each strand of mitochondria is one of these gray lines here so you can see there's a whole bunch of gray lines the white areas are just areas where the machinery lost to segments so don't worry about those. This is all done with DNA analysis.

So what we do is we stack up a whole bunch of the mitochondria that we get from the sample so that we can do statistical analysis on it. The black lines and the little blue dots here represent damage to the mitochondrial DNA.

And you can see here, and we have an algorithm, we've figured there's about 25% damage. If you look at this one, this is from a 62-year-old donor, which happens to be me. This is my mitochondrial DNA. I have exactly the same mitochondrial DNA as my mom because it is passed from mother to child with no changes.

This is completely different from nuclear DNA, which everybody thinks about DNA as the nuclear DNA that you get from your mother and your father, and it combines, and it's got 23 chromosomes. Most people don't realize you have an enormous amount of mitochondrial DNA. It comes straight from your mother, and it came from her mother, and her mother and her mother. So it's really a family DNA. If you go to a fifth cousin, once removed, you'll find exactly the same code. Okay. So it's very interesting. And that traces all the way back to mitochondrial Eve in Africa, 300,000 years ago.

So if you look at the two mitochondria, you notice the difference. Look at how trashed my mom's mitochondria are and mine are less so. This is my nephew who's 32 who has the same mitochondria as I do because it came through my sister. Um his are even less damaged he has a damage score of seven percent I have 11.

So we can we can chart these damage scores and we can see the decline of mitochondrial quality over the course of the years. And by the way, this is not exact at all. I mean, we started at 60%. This is a very, very, a very new field, the analysis of mitochondrial DNA. There are people who are doing this on a very large scale, this kind of analysis, and finding all kinds of amazing correlation between mitochondrial change in the body and disease.

So if your curve is this blue one, then, you know, we figure, oh, well, you're probably going to make it to about 95. If your curve is this gray one, you probably going to die younger. So this a lot of what what we see as death from an old age is really controlled by how quickly your mitochondria are getting burned up. Or perhaps you started with a bad set from birth.

There are people that are born with bad mitochondria in some percentage. If there are children that are born with a horrible disease called primary mitochondrial disease they don't even live in many cases they don't live past the age of two it's terrible and because their mitochondria are they're born with broken mitochondria from birth as I always say they're born with 100 year old mitochondria in a six-month-old body okay which is a terrible thing.

But if you're a smoker you can almost be guaranteed that your mitochondria are going to be getting burned out really rapidly it was one of the reasons that smokers die young. If you get chemotherapy you'll see you'll actually see a big drop like boom because chemotherapy kills mitochondria that's what it does it's actually designed to do that.

If you get uh any chronic disease we're actually looking at the possibility of that long COVID may be caused to some extent by permanent damage to the mitochondria in the body.

And then there's also this question of what happens if you get below a certain point. We think that what happens is it triggers a whole bunch of these age-related diseases because the body is struggling to deal with the lack of energy. And these other things, for instance, Alzheimer's. I just had a meeting with two Alzheimer's experts yesterday, and they're absolutely convinced that Alzheimer's is triggered by mitochondrial deficit. The cells don't have enough energy. They can't keep the waste products, keep going with their waste disposal, which is very important in the brain, that things get mucked up and that causes Alzheimer's.

# Mitochondrial Replacement Strategy

Okay. So here's the point of all this. What we want to do is give you a boost. Okay. And you can see here where I've, I've very hopefully and optimistically drawn this line out to 130, 140 years old, okay?

If we could boost your mitochondria every whatever number of years to make up for the fact that they're continuing to decline, maybe we can keep people older, keep people going. And we are doing this with animals and it works. We doing it with animals a lot. And there a lot of other people too. It not just us. As I said there teams all over the world right now working on this.

So let me explain how this actually works. When we talk about mitochondrial transplantation to you, it would seem as simple as a blood transfusion. We've even looked at the possibility of injecting it. You might even be able to inject it yourself. People get therapies right now where they inject immune components to bolster their immune systems. A lot of this now is being done at home.

But you would essentially would look like a bag of yellow liquid and you would put it into your blood or maybe you inject it into your tummy fat. And what happens is that the mitochondria in that solution. There's a lot going on behind the scenes. There's a huge amount of biology and chemistry that goes into making this work. But to you as a patient, it would just look like a blood transfusion.

By the way, I just want to mention again that mitochondrial transplantation within the body is, as they say, evolutionarily conserved and pervasive. It's happening everywhere. When you get a stem cell therapy, a very big part of the value of the stem cells is the fact that they donate freshly made mitochondria to the tissues nearby. They actually extrude these little tubes. And we have pictures of this. We have videos. You can see the mitochondria marching down this little tiny tube into the cell.

And they don't do it with cells that are healthy. They only do it with cells that are old. So there's a signaling mechanism in the body where the cells can actually say, hey, I need more. And the stem cell comes over and gives them a replenishment.

Okay. So when we talk about doing mitochondrial transplantation, we're just doing what the body is already doing. You already have in your bloodstream a thing called mitelets, what we call mitelets. Mitelets are tiny, as I think I mentioned to you, your platelets have, your platelets in your bloodstream contain mitochondria that are fresh and young. They were manufactured in your bone marrow, given to the platelet.

The platelet lives for about 10 days. At the end of the 10 days it taken off to be recycled in the spleen. But right before it gets recycled it squirts out all of its mitochondria in these little lifeboats which we call like extracellular vesicles or mitelets. Okay. I actually made up that name.

And they get absorbed by all the other tissues nearby. And so mitochondria are recycled. They're never thrown away by the body if it can possibly avoid throwing them away. They're not easy to get and they're not easy to get from nature because they're so valuable. They're super valuable. They're hard to make. They require a tremendous amount of energy to build and a tremendous amount of energy to maintain.

So your cells are very, very well evolved to keep your mitochondria healthy and to recycle them constantly. Okay. And that's why we live to be 85 years old instead of, you know, some animals only live to be 30. We live to be 85. One of the reasons is that we have very good mitochondrial recycling in our body.

And here's a little picture of a nice little cartoon of the platelet releasing the mitelet with the mitochondria inside of it. It floats over. It gets absorbed by neutrophils. It gets absorbed by white blood cells, T cells, and re-energizes the immune system.

Here's another graph from a paper where they showed the flux of mitochondria in the blood, and you can see it's going down. Also, the mitochondria are less powerful. As I said, the mitochondrial DNA tends to decline. And so that means that the DNA is no longer functioning properly, which means that the mitochondria is no longer generating energy properly because it's got bad code in its DNA.

And we think that that is one of the two or three top causes of aging. I know there's 15 hallmarks of aging. We're trying to look for what are the actual cause as opposed to the downstream effect. We think that mitochondrial DNA degeneration and nuclear DNA degeneration, which was what people call epigenetic damage, those are the two core reasons that we age. It's genetic decline.

Okay. Some of you are probably following the epigenetic reprogramming field, and there's a bunch of companies working on that. There's a lot of very, very well-funded organizations who are working on epigenetic reprogramming. From our perspective, we want to team up with them because we're doing the mitochondrial side, they're doing the nuclear side. Both of those ideally should be repaired in order to do age extension, life extension.

# Sourcing and Bioreactor Production of Mitochondria

So the next big question is, really the main question is, okay, great, mitochondrial transplantation, where are we going to get them from? Okay, we can't squeeze them out of teenagers. The teenagers are not going to sit still for that. I guarantee you. Okay. And it's not like we need small amounts. You need vast quantities.

You are losing, according to our best rough estimates, by the time you're 80, you're losing somewhere between 20 and 40% of your inventory of mitochondrial DNA. That's quintillions of mitochondria, enormous numbers. Okay. You are 10% mitochondria by weight. Okay, so we're not talking about small numbers here.

We have to, if we're going to refresh you and refill you back up with new mitochondria, we're talking about quadrillions and quadrillions of mitochondria. Where are we going to get them all?

Well, the only way to do this on any kind of socially acceptable, ethical way is we have to grow them. And so that is what our primary focus is as a company.

Here's another little diagram that kind of shows the whole cycle. Uh this is this is one way of doing this we take the mitochondria from your stem cells we take some of your stem cells out of your blood we put them in great big enormous 2000 liter uh stem cell bioreactors we grow vast amounts of it we extract the mitochondria from it we put it into some coatings to protect it from the immune system and then we inject it back into your bloodstream.

And the coating would have ideally the coating will have a receptor built into it so that we can actually target them to specific organs. So if you got heart trouble or if you have premature blindness, you're getting AMD. I mean, by the time you reach 78 years old, there's a lot of potential things that could be going wrong.

If you get sick and you've got an infection, you're in the hospital, we want to be able to give your doctor a toolkit of mitochondria so they can fix whatever's the biggest risk for you right at that moment. Otherwise, we just give them to you and your whole system and your whole system just starts regaining strength.

# Preclinical Data and Applications

I'll just show you, here's some of the best data. We've been doing studies now for three years. We've done a lot of injections. We've looked at the brain. We've looked at the immune system. We've looked at muscle strength. I have a huge series of injections going on right now at one of our labs at University of Kentucky, where we've actually gotten up to the point where we're now injecting, I think we've hit 6% of the animal's mitochondria that we have supplemented now. Improve it, we've increased at 6% with young mitochondria into an older animal.

This is what the kind of results we see when we do that, okay? This was an experiment where we took older mice, the equivalent of maybe 60 years old by human age, and we gave them a fatal dose of sepsis. The orange line of the mice that got that sepsis and did not get any kind of a treatment within 24 hours they were all dead bacterial infection the blue line is when we gave them we gave them mitelit injections we gave them three injections right at the very start and you can see one two three uh and then they they slowly we they still died but we we slowed it way down okay we think we're going to go back redo this and give them and continue giving them injections we think that after a week or so that they'd be cleared completely of the disease.

We tested their cytokines. We've tested their blood bacteria. Everything is down a factor of 10. Okay.

We also did this for viral infections the H1N1 flu. Same thing. We have another person who did this at Stanford and they tested this with T specifically designed to do this with T-cells. And I think they were testing it against the TB, tuberculosis virus. This was in a test tube, not in a mouse. They got the same thing with T-cells.

So if we can boost T cells, then you begin to think, well, T cells go against cancer. So we really want to try this against cancer, maybe merge it with CAR T therapy.

So you can see there's all kinds of opportunities here. Just looking at the immune system, if we can supply spare battery packs, think of think of your immune cells as being as being little roving battery powered uh you know units the mitochondria when they're out there fighting against uh an infection their mitochondria get burned out very quickly just like like batteries and uh we we wanted to just give them spares and that's what we did here we gave them this this big chunk of young healthy mitochondria.

And so from a human perspective, if you're 75 years old, you're in the ICU with some disease, they can't get rid of it. Maybe we could give you a big old dollop of young mitochondria and make your immune system think it's 30 years old again. You get out of the hospital because young people with young immune systems just don't get as sick.

So the opportunities are pretty big. I'll skip over a lot of this other stuff we're doing a bunch of tests in in doing eyes doing vision correction you can inject mitochondria directly into the vitreous of the eye and they actually migrate into this picture over here this kind of weird looking thing that red up there that's glob of mitochondria in the vitreol fluid this is what they call the optic nerve head and you can see this red color. Those are the mitochondria. You can see them. They're actually floating down and getting into the optic nerve head and they're migrating into the optic nerve.

Now if you can replace the mitochondria in the optic nerve then you can potentially prevent glaucoma because glaucoma is a mitochondrial deficiency disease.

So I jump over the rest of this. So if you talk about and as I said a lot of people doing this work. And if you go to our website, we have tons of papers on this.

# Longevity Goals and Laptop Analogy

So what's our goal? Our goal is to, you know, obviously we'd like to cure a bunch of diseases, but the big goal is, can we use this technique to give ourselves longer lifespans. And yes, we would be healthier. We'd be younger. We'd have stronger muscles, but it isn't just about, you know, I want to get past that 95 year mark. That seems to be the limit. I want to get to 120. I want to get to 130.

Okay. I don't think the mitochondria are the entire solution, but we, what the, the approach we use is what we call a laptop refurbishment model. We figure that to refurbish our bodies, we're going to need three or four different treatments.

And if anybody who's ever rebuilt the laptop could tell you the first thing you do is you put in a new battery. Because if you don't have the energy, you can't rewrite the operating system. You can't do any of these other things that you need to do. You can't clean up the hard disk. You need a fresh battery. That's just minimum requirement.

Okay. And so that's our goal is to replace the battery. Okay. And then there's other people who could do the other pieces.

# Q&A Session

I better look at some of my chat questions here.

Okay, someone said, Tom, what is the conceptual link between your work and the Life Extension PQQ product? I don't know what that is, but I'm assuming you're talking about there are a variety of vitamins and supplements that are purported to help mitochondria. There's also red light therapy, which is using LEDs to put extra energy into the mitochondria. There's a bunch of companies actually developing some pretty serious, what I call chemical enhancements.

So the difference between them and us is just a difference of how aggressive we're being. Think of what we're doing as being 10,000 times more ambitious than what they're doing. I mean yes you can certainly improve your diet and you can make your mitochondria a little better but the bottom line is going back to our picture way back here, here's the decline of the mitochondria, okay?

If you're down here and you're 90 years old and your mitochondria have declined 40%, 50%, sure, if you improve your diet, you might get 1% improvement. But then it's just going to keep going down because this decline is based on genetic damage. It's actual noise. It's creeping into your genes, into your genetic structure. You can't fix that with a nutrient. Okay.

The nutrient helps the mitochondria work a little better. It might supply some chemicals in these, but you can't change the fact that you've got this genetic decline. The only way to fix genetic decline that we know of is to just give you new ones.

Okay? And going back to the battery analogy, I remember when I was a kid, you guys probably remember this, they used to have battery rebuild kits where you could, if you had an old battery in the car, you could get, you know, you could pour new fluid in there and you could try to put in chemicals. And they said, oh yeah, it'll keep your battery going longer.

We don't do that anymore. All the batteries are sealed. You can't put new fluid in them. You can't put battery, nobody sells battery extenders because it just doesn't really work. Once the battery goes bad, the electrodes get worn out, the chemical goes bad. Easiest thing to do is you just pull it out and you put in a new one. And that is the way all cars work these days.

And so that's what we're saying. We're not trying to make the mitochondria work better. We're just going to give you new ones. Okay. So I don't take them myself. I just, I make sure I eat my vegetables.

Okay, Walter had a question. Can normal distribution of mitelets that happen to be diseased be a cause of spreading pathology? That's a good question. I don't know. Probably. Once again, keep in mind, we're like a teeny little company. We don't even have an office. I have all these labs working for us, and I'm running this all out of my home office.

So this is really new and there so much work to do i mean this is this could be we could spend 50 years working on this uh in the in the world and take a long time to uncover it all.

Somebody said I 89 so my mitochondria probably have significant genetic damage. Yes. If you clone them, doesn't that damage just gets passed along? Thank you. That was exactly the question that I should be addressing next.

Let me go back to the bioreactor thing. So let's say we put your stem cells into a bioreactor and we expand them and by the way that what generally what we're saying is we're going to expand your stem cells about 10,000x that's how much we're going to do it's a huge amount well if we're just got 89 year old mitochondria and we inject them back into you that's not going to do any good you already have those.

Our process is set up to eliminate the bad ones during the growth process. And I don't talk about exactly how we do that because that's secret. But if you think about it, if there wasn't a way to make mitochondria younger, our species wouldn't exist. There'd be no babies, you know, because the bottom line is every human egg cell contains somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 copies of the mother's mitochondrial DNA.

People don't know this. Everybody thinks you've got an egg cell and you've got 23 chromosomes in there from the nuclear DNA and it gets fertilized and it creates a new DNA, right? And that's about 8 billion, it's about 8 billion base pairs that are in your nuclear DNA. People don't realize that your egg cell has almost exactly the same amount of genetic information, somewhere between six and eight billion mitochondrial DNA. 500,000 copies times 16,000 bits, 16,000 base pairs is around six to eight billion mitochondria.

So your egg cell actually contains a completely alien DNA. Okay, it's not yours. It's passed down from the family. And they never talk about this in the textbooks because it wasn't really even known up until a few years ago.

So that perfect mitochondrial DNA is the reason that babies are young. That what youth is. And how does the female reproductive system create those egg cells with that perfect mitochondria when her mitochondria are damaged? Of course, the older she gets, the harder it is, right? Because she's got less and less healthy mitochondria to get.

But we know that there is a technique that the female reproductive system uses to clean out the bad ones. However is extremely energy intensive which is why our bodies don't do it if there was a simple way to clean up our mitochondria and get rid of the bad ones we'd already be living to be 300 years old okay the reason that we age is because the takes more energy than our bodies can maintain that's my theory of aging right there.

Animals that only live to be 30 years old like antelopes and wolves and so forth we think that one of the reasons is that they burn their mitochondria out faster because they have to run they've got to escape we're primates we don't run around and use energy at those levels we have we come from a primate line that is optimized for age in order to optimize for the knowledge of the elders so that the that the tribe if you look at a gorilla a group of gorillas gorillas live to be about 60 okay they're very very long lived for their size the reason that gorillas have that long life is because they're protecting their mitochondria and they're protecting their elders because the elders have the information that the group needs to successfully live in that area right and the human race is especially that way we're we're very good at extending extending our mitochondria this is all theory.

So the bottom line is that we have to grow the mitochondria in enormous quantities and then we have to we have to call out the bad ones so this is going to take a while and it will take a lot of energy and a lot of materials this is going to be a huge tank that is basically cloning your cells and and improving them along the way.

That some people have also said could you just make these could you just since this is all family mitochondria couldn you um couldn you just use a generic group of mitochondria and that is possible i mean if you go to Sweden for example the truth is if you go to these countries where there's a a very heterogeneous uh ethnic group most countries actually other than the United States we're kind of a mix of everything right but if you go to Sweden if you go to Ethiopia people generally have very very almost identical mitochondria so is it possible that the Swedish government could grow a great big giant factory of mitochondria and just distribute them to everybody sure that's that's absolutely a goal the goal the long-term goal is to manufacture these on a global scale and give them as a supplement to everybody but as you can imagine and that's a big project.

Martin asked, are we epigenetically reprogramming the mitochondria? No, it's a different thing. We are doing the equivalent of that. We're just getting rid of the bad ones. We're not actually reprogramming them. Other people are trying to do that. However, there's other companies that are trying to epigenetically reprogram the mitochondria. So it's not that it's not being tried. That's just not our approach.

Epigenetic reprogramming in the nuclear DNA, of course, is that's where you send in new code and you basically kind of paste it over the existing bad code, shall we say. It's like rewriting the operating system on your hard disk.

So let me just see if there's any other interesting tidbits here. I mean, obviously, I'm not going to talk. I'm not going to go into detail about our company. We've got patents and so forth here. We've got a number of different approaches to this. We are raising money, by the way. I'll just mention that.

But I want to go back to this first diagram where I talked about this process. And as I said by the way Martin who's on the call here is one of our volunteers thank you Martin and Elaine I think Elaine's probably there too I can't see your picture um and Walt is also a volunteer so we've got a number of you here we also have a number of people in your group who've invested uh Fiona Miller is one of our investors and has been some from day one almost and has been a great supporter.

Um so what what this is all coming into here right now is this idea that we're going to actually try this, okay, in human beings.

# Human Trials Rationale and Plans

And I just want to mention real quickly, why are we doing this now? The first question I always get from other scientists is, they always say, well, God, shouldn't you wait another couple of years? You know, do this in mice more, learn more about it. That's certainly the way that most biotech works in the United States. You take your time and you go slow.

What about doing this in dogs what about doing it in monkeys first and we've been been through all that actually we did this in some we did a dog trial and we got the same results there's nothing in this that tells us that it's going to change when we go to different animals except the immune system mice have very easy immune systems so you don't have any kind of reactions human beings have extremely fussy immune systems so immune reactions are a big concern absolutely uh dogs immune systems are not that reactive so the bottom line is the reason we're doing this now and i mean you know our goal is to do this next year basically as soon as we get funded get the funding we need to get we're gonna we're gonna go um and of course you know we would have already been doing this if we'd been able to get the funding a year and a half ago but the but the funding market just collapsed. So it's, it's recovering now.

So, um, I'll just mention, um, why are we doing it so quickly? Because you have to, um, you have to start with human beings eventually. And when you go into human beings, you're going to have to start from scratch. That's the bottom line. I mean, you have to do it so safely and so carefully and so slowly that doing it in animals is almost just, I don't know that it has a lot of value and there's a lot of ethical issues and the animals can tell you very much.

A lot of this is it very hard to judge how successful this is a lot of it going to be whether it feels good to people this should be the reverse of chemotherapy when you get chemotherapy you feel terrible because you're poisoning your body this is really the complete opposite we're trying to recharge you and so a lot of the human element is important to us for these kinds of trials.

And I also want to mention that it's, I mean, these trials, this will be the first time we've ever done it at this scale in human beings. And we want to establish safety for the world. I mean, there's a lot of people who want to do this. This is a big, big industry. So our volunteers are going to be, are going to be, you know, really pioneering this.

So let's see. Someone asked about volunteering. Just contact me if you're interested. And somebody also asked about cell sorters. We're not really using cell sorters or an idea, but we're not using them.

So why don't I, let's see, how much time do we have here? Oh, that was 50 minutes. That was 45 minutes. That's plenty. Why don't we just throw it open and anybody who wants to chat or ask questions, please.

# Live Q&A: Mitochondria Roles and Management

Okay. Anybody else have uh well i had learned somewhere that mitochondria have a lot of effects in managing and controlling things in the body and you know you've talked a lot about energy uh creation but what about uh managing and controlling?

Well, that's a big, a big question. No, they're, they're making enormous, there's making enormous strides in understanding mitochondrial contribution to the management of the cell and the management of the body. And, you know, basically, remember the mitochondria have been part of us for a billion and a half years, okay, or 1.25 billion years, whatever it is.

So they are they were here before we were we were built around them that's what i will say we were built around okay so that's why i say when i say there were a robot they built so they could go and explore the world um they and the nuclear the mitochondrial dna and nuclear dna are in constant communication in fact there have been some researchers who who stated that mitochondria are actually where most of the processing is happening because processing takes energy so it actually makes sense that you'd have the processing happening in the mitochondrial dna and the nuclear dna serves more as a database but the actual day-to-day subprocessing processing and the sensing those mitochondria are floating around all of your body and all of your cells and they're collecting information inside the cell and passing that information back and forth to the nuclear dna so that they together they can make decisions about what to do because running a cell is a fantastically complicated we don't even And we have no idea how it's all managed. It's out of this world. It really is.

And then just running the mitochondrial energy production, you know, it's got to deal with all kinds of changes. And what happens if you're in a famine? What happens if you're in low oxygen? What happens if you're eating a lot more fat than you are glucose? That mitochondria, it's got a tremendous job to manage its energy production.

And don't forget that the surface of the mitochondria is covered with tiny little jet turbines. That's how it generates energy. It actually has a spinning molecule that is spinning at 5,000 RPM. And it's generating little ATP molecules. And it's driven by hot gas. It is a steam. It is a jet turbine. Literally. And you are you are your your life exists you exist because you are full of tiny little jet turbines and so as Yoda would say we are energy beings right.

Um let me let me get up here okay what's your contact information oh i'll put up i'll put up my i'll put it up here right now It's Tom at Mitrix.bio. You can go to our website. Actually the easiest thing is just go to our website and go to our contact page and that get through to us.

# Live Q&A: Family Donors and Volunteer Criteria

Okay I sorry Go ahead Next question I was going to ask and maybe it more practical for you than anything else but for people who are getting treatment if we happen to have a matriarchal line of for instance my sister grandchildren my sister granddaughter I guess Well, no, any of my sister's grandchildren could provide my mitochondria, right? And it would require less filtering. Does that have any value to you? Or is your filtering good enough?

Maybe. Maybe. Sure. You know, I mean, if one of your sister's daughters, you know, decide to have a baby, boy, that placenta, the placenta is a great source of young mitochondria. Okay. I would save that but again we may figure out oh we don't need it it's like remember when everybody was saving cord blood for the stem cells we did that when the kids were young eventually they kind of figured out we don't really need it because we know how to get it from your own body but this is where placental stem cells are still being used very widely yeah i don't want to be known as uncle dracula anyways uncle dracula exactly i want your blood i just want a little blood i told my kids that but see i for me my kids do me no good because they didn't get my mitochondria right so i have to go to my nephew and he's like no you ain't getting any my mitochondria uncle tom.

Um what are the qualifications and disqualifications for participation. It's mainly, we're just looking for people who are generally over 65. And by the way, I'll just mention, people say, well, how come I can't do it if I'm 45? Because if you're 45, you're mitochondria already in pretty good shape. That's the truth. I know that we'd all like to be 25, go from 45 to 25, but at 45, you're mitochondria in pretty good shape.

And so I would need so many young mitochondria to flush out to give you really any kind of noticeable boost. Whereas someone who's 70, 80 years old, their mitochondria are in bad shape. So it's gonna be really easy to see a benefit for them. It's just dilution factors.

So we're starting with people mitochondria in bad shape. So I'm going to, it's going to be really easy to see a benefit for them. It's just dilution factors. So we're starting with people, and this is really key to the research. We work with older animals. If you're working with young animals, it doesn't, you don't see anything. They've already got young mitochondria so that you don't, you don't get any signal out of it.

We're also, you know, we're being careful not to, we don't want to work with people who have active cancer because cancer is a complex question we think it's resolvable but we don't want to deal with that now and we can't work with people who have severe dementia just because we can't get that wouldn't be it's not legal.

# Live Q&A: Biomarkers and Testing

So um there's a question here from Rick what biologic and phenotypic markers will be assessing for proof of concept well just so you know i mean we've done this with animals we've done this with and so we get a lot of you know we look at their muscle strength. We look at how much they can run on the wheel. We look at the mitochondrial energy levels in their brain.

If you look at our papers, you've seen that we've covered everything we can do, really. With human beings, what we'll be doing is looking at really, it'll be very similar to the XPRIZE that's currently being done. We'll be looking at muscle, cognition, immune system, and skin. Those are the four areas that we're going to be evaluating.

A lot of this will be like with skin. I mean, you have to do a visual assessment. We have a judging panel of kind of prominent people and the judging panel, a part of the purpose of the judging panel is to make sure that this is all being done really well. We don't want it to be shady at all.

This is where, I mean, we're working with Stanford and Harvard and some of the best universities in the world. So this is going to be very very high-end uh project and the judging panel will look one of their jobs is to look at the skin and look at the appearance of the body and then you can do muscle strength the the trick is you can't just take someone and give them exercises and say oh they're stronger therefore they're younger we all know that's not real that's just it just means you're making your muscles stronger it doesn't mean you you've changed your age okay but that's really hard to separate out and and that like a big debate right now in the field so we have a whole bunch of of external and internal we have a lot of blood testing we have our own test of the mitochondrial dna that we be using obviously to guide to see whether or not we've effect we've improved the quality of the mitochondrial dna.

Uh how much travel would the volunteers have to do a lot because this will be probably done in japan or um in the bahamas so there will be significant travel.

Uh is there a test to accurately measure the health of mitochondria yes is there a test to accurately measure the health of mitochondria yes and that is the one i showed you at the beginning are we still sharing the screen or did i turn it off it's off but is that uh test available for anyone just as a fee for not yet we're not allowed to sell it because it's so new and we didn't get any approval for it and so it's right now we're still just collecting part of what we'll be doing with all of our volunteers we'll be doing tests on all of them constantly because we want to see the progression uh right now that test costs many thousands of dollars to do because it's all done manually and so we can't just uh and and we can't sell it because you're not allowed to do that so we can only do it for free so we we can only do it enough we have it's kind of weird you have to have the funding in order to in order to do these things.

Jason asked are you able to create an exact match of a youthful mitochondrial copy of the only younger or is it only from donors no Jason the the idea is that we could take your see everybody has a mixture of good and bad when i say younger what i really mean is that you have a lot of good you have more good than bad it's like black marbles and white marbles okay and as you get older you have a larger and larger and larger percent uh ratio of black marbles to white marbles. The black ones are bad. The white ones are good, if that makes sense.

And so what we're doing is basically cleaning out the black marbles so that you only have, you have more of the white ones left.

What organs will you target or full body? Full body is the main goal We can target organs because we have a targeting molecule that we building into the coating that we put on the mitochondria to protect them They also have a targeting molecule that will take them over and put them into a specific organ. There's a lot of work that needs to go into that. We've developed a couple different versions of that for different organs.

So can we use the VO2 max test to test the health of mitochondria yes that is going to be on our list for sure um of things we test but again the vo2 test you can you can tweak that just by exercising and riding your bike more so we have to make sure that our people are already at the same level of of conditioning that they're going to stay at so that we know that whatever we're improving is not due to them just exercising more okay and so our volunteers we're going to be driving them to exercise they're already most of our volunteers are already people who are really in excellent shape who've already taken care of themselves they've already been working on this they're getting to be 78 years old and they realize that hey you know i'm seeing this decline that i can't stop with any of the other techniques and so that's they're all they're all seeing it their own and their own body.

Have you seen any side effects or adverse reactions not so far in our animal tests we've seen zero adverse reactions we have tried we have not been able to get them there i want to mention there have been this has been done in human beings not just by by just not by us people have done this in human beings already on very very small scales for very narrowly focused diseases.

There's surgeons at Harvard who are already using these injections of mitochondria to restore the health of the heart during cardiac surgery they bring the heart back to life because there's always you always have some loss during surgery and they inject mitochondria in there and they bring them back to life and then they close up and then you end up with more function that's very common they They're already using it for treating clots, blood clots and ischemia in the leg. They're using it to treat children who have mitochondrial diseases.

There are some babies that it appears that their lives have been saved by mitochondrial transplants in Israel another company that doing this in Israel So this isn the first time it be done for human beings It just we doing it on this massive scale and we're doing it to bring people back from old age, as opposed to saving the lives of children.

I also want to say our goal is once we've proven this with adults, with older adults, We absolutely want to be using this to treat children, of course. I mean, we'll have a certain minimum amount of our project that we'll be doing pro bono for children's diseases. And again, this is a case where the adults are going to be testing this and making sure it's safe so that we can use it for children.

# Live Q&A: Dosing Protocol and Autologous vs. Allogeneic

Other questions? I don't see any other questions. I've been talking and talking. So maybe that's enough. What do you think, Johnny? Is that enough? Any more questions? Anyone? Any more questions? Go ahead, Jeff.

What is the protocol for the actual procedure? Is it one time or is it repeated weekly or how often do you get the treatment?

Very good question and the answer is nobody has ever done this anywhere ever so the truth is we don't know remember this is not natural it's never been done in nature before that any any animal has ever been able to refresh its amount of (mitochondria? "condom"?) so the answer is i don't know i mean the the current plan we're just at this point we're guessing we're figuring that we'll do a treatment an infusion once or twice a month, maybe for a year. Okay. Maybe once every two months, maybe we'll be able to do it all at once. I doubt it.

You know, remember that we're talking about replenishing. We're talking about refilling you with anywhere from two to 10% of your mitochondria. So it's a lot. We're talking about adding massive amounts of new material to your body. Well your body's going to need time and mitochondria move around and so it should work right and it works in the animals we've done it with i'm we have animals now that are up to six percent replaced mitochondria and they are absolutely healthy in fact they're more than healthy.

But we're not going to push them there we've definitely overdosed them too and that doesn't work they they die okay you can just you just overload somebody and it's just too much um this is very similar to stem cell treatment by the way so for those of you who've gone and done done stem cells in the Bahamas, or you've done them in Beverly Hills, you've gotten a facial, you've gotten knee injections, whatever you've done with stem cells. Think of this as being stem cells times 10,000.

Our treatment should be, according to our calculations, it should be the equivalent of 10,000 stem cell treatments. And that's how we get the effect. In theory, stem cell treatments actually are making you younger because they are donating mitochondria to your to your cells but it's just too small it's just not enough.

So i gotta follow up for you tom uh quick follow up on on that question regarding um like if you're thinking about the mitochondria you're saying what you know say white and black ones white ones being the good ones so what what you're putting into the body is this something that your body already has some of those, like you may already have, I'm just giving like small numbers to make sense. If you have 10 white mitochondria already, and you have say 10 black, you're really putting in 10 more white and trying to remove those other 10 black. You're not really putting in something from a donor or from something mysterious. It's really something that's already in your body. Is that right?

Well, look, there's, and yeah, I talked about this, but it's definitely complicated. So let me just refresh this. There's two approaches to any kind of regenerative medicine. You could do autologous or allogeneic. Okay. Those are the words. Autologous means that you're taking your own cells, your own mitochondria, and you're growing them and then putting them back in. Okay. It's your own stuff. Allogeneic means you're taking somebody else's and inject them into you.

So if you go get stem cell therapy, there's two different types of stem cell therapy. There's There's a stem cell therapy where they take it from your tummy fat and they inject it into your hip. That autologous stem cell therapy There also stem cell therapy where you get it from a donor Maybe you get it from somebody cord blood or you get it from somebody placenta That allogeneic stem cells And the allogeneic stem cells do not have your DNA in them. They have somebody else's DNA.

So what we're talking about right now is autologous. We're going to grow your mitochondria, but we're just going to make sure that there's more of them that are good as opposed to bad. Right now my mitochondria let's say are 70 good and 30 bad which means 30 of my mitochondrial dna have been damaged with some sort of bad code some bad deletions in the in the code okay it's like it's like bad sectors on a hard disk so i have 30 of my mitochondrial dna i mean they're just they're still mine they're just they've been they've been ground up and trashed by by the day to day life uh if i take my mitochondria out that's 70 30 and i grow them in a bioreactor and i figure out a way to get to reduce that ratio so it's now 90 good and 10 bad you never get to 100 but if i can get it to 90 90 10 and then i put them back into myself i'm improving that 70-30 ratio.

Just a quick follow-up on that. I mean, say the 70% that are good also have some mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, even though that 30%, maybe it's like they have dramatic mutations, but even that other 70%, and I mean, I don't know if we can measure this or not, but say there's also, you know, say those are still quite different than when you were 20 are you able to recreate like a brand new mitochondria with with the new dna like it was when someone was was 20 or would it still be using you know what i'm saying

I don't know yet you you the question it's a great question you are on the edge of even my speculation much less my facts okay so i mean this is we just don't even know and and as i said every every human egg cell starts with 500, 300 to 500,000 copies of perfect mitochondria. Well, that's actually not actually true. Your egg cell has a mixture. And by the way, it's not true that they're all from your mother. There's actually sometimes other ones creep in. The mitochondria from their sperm sometimes float over and get in there right and so there a huge biological like species level questions coming up here about how does mother nature do this and it is really interesting and you could look at the research i if you want to look at the question of how youth is created.

How do our bodies create a young replicate of ourselves? You could read, there's a guy named Nick Lane out of the UK who has been studying this extensively. He's a mitochondrial expert. He gets quoted by Bill Gates. He's a great guy. And he writes lots of papers analyzing the energy uh the energy development and the and the use of mitochondria in the in the gestation so how is youth created by nature and we're trying to basically hide we're trying to basically replicate that using in a machine we're creating a youth serum i mean it is a youth serum is what it is. It's just, it's the same use that we already have in our bodies. We're just trying to make more of it.

Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it.

Sure.

# Live Q&A: Overdose Risks and Costs

You mentioned that there, that it is possible to overdose on this treatment. I presume that was with animal studies. How do you know what that level is with humans?

Oh we're going to start really small okay and and we we've done you know that's what you do when you when you're this is what we're doing with humans is a it's called a phase one safety trial right and to do safety trials what do you do you do dosing studies but we've done this with with animals we think that it should scale proportionally to weight there's really no reason i mean the Immune systems are different. So that is certainly a huge consideration.

But we think that if you inject too many, it just, you know, intravenous injection. If you inject too many stem cells, you can kill somebody. You just clog up the, you end up clogging up the capillaries in the lungs. Lungs are the first place that any intravenous injection goes.

So we had some mice We gave them great big giant intravenous doses and they died So we did that until we figured out what was safe We'll be doing a lot more of that before the human tests. That'll be one of the things we'll be doing is a lot more safety tests in animals before we do any humans.

And then when we do the humans, we'll be starting with really tiny, just skin injections, just to see if we see a reaction. And then we'll start with slightly larger ones and so forth. So.

Estimated future costs. High. It's going to cost a lot. In the beginning. This is going to be I mean, you can imagine I'm trying to replace. 10 of your mitochondria that's hard work um but it's not really an egg now costs we just don't know it's it's more about how much do we need to invest to build the infrastructure any technology i mean if i if i was the first person to make a semiconductor how much would a you know the very first the very first integrated semiconductor chip how much did that cost well millions of dollars you know many many millions of dollars but that's not the issue the issue is can you mass produce it a question is how much do we need to invest in capital to get up to mass production levels and that's you know a lot millions and millions hundreds of millions of dollars potentially but that's just true of any mass production environment so how much money did it take to build tesla lots.

Well outstanding any more questions that was more that's an hour and 10 minutes of just talking so any other questions well worth the investment in time great crowd i mean the nice thing is i'm getting people who are already thinking about this and And that is really wonderful. And a lot of you have already done your own tests. You've tried things. I hear from people all the time who've tried different interventions themselves.

Well, that's what we're about here. Action and results, not just theory. Right.

So. Well, that's what we're about here. Action and results, not just theory. Right. OK, well, as I said, go to my contact page. Leave me a note if you want. And thank you for your. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for setting this up. Thank you, Johnny and Tom. Very nice. Thank you, Tom. Thank you.

All right, everybody go enjoy your Saturday.

# Transition to General Discussion

Yeah, well, let's move on to our general discussion and open it up. Anybody have anything you want to talk about? You want to turn off the recording so that you get a clean... Well, we'll do that a little later. Okay, fine. That's, I just, I was... I'm going to hang out if that's okay. Yeah, anybody? Does anybody want to talk about something you don't want recorded for posterity. Well, this is lively. Well, all right. If we're all out of things, I have something to show you. It's my latest generation in this plasma study I'm doing. It's a slide deck.

# Johnny Adams: Plasma Therapies for Age Reversal

So um i guess you will be subjected to that uh or some of you might even be interested i think it's uh one of the two most well now that we know about mitochondria the one of the three most interesting exciting things we could do so okay bear with me just a moment here i will set it up all righty and i will share my screen and i trust everyone can see what we headed for this is a real rich guy that the grave this is the grim reaper standing between him grim reaper is pointing to stacks and stacks of cash and jewelry and trophies and money And this guy just telling them, you can't take it with you.

So, well, about that. This is what I'm going to do. This is self-explanatory. I'm working on it. And those of you, you know, all of us here to a limited extent, very limited extent, we've done some of this, but we need to take it not from like here to here, a year or two, or maybe even three or four, five or 10. What we're going to do is take it down to 20, 30, 40 years rejuvenation.

So I'm Johnny Adams and everyone here, we know each other. We've known each other 10, 15, 20 years, some of us. But my life for the last four decades is working on aging solutions and building skills and meeting people like all of you and refining methods and building broad practical skills, etc. You can read the rest of this. I'll send this slide deck to you. Actually, it's up on the website as well.

But here, hey, we're still there? Yeah, I don't know what happened. Where'd you go? I had a internet disconnection. I'm glad everyone else is still here. So let us resume. Bang so okay let's take a look at the website if it'll let us this is agingintervention.org this is the stuff i'm working on kind of goes on and on all right enough of that and let's go back to this is a background summary i've been working on this plasma arena since about 2015.

We started off in the young plasma arena and then shifted to umbilical cord plasma. So okay let go back to this And the website has a lot of different interesting things on it including a link to our YouTube channel So... Ah. All right.

These are some of the organizations I'm active in. And, okay, so I've researched and done dozens of age reversal therapies. And one of the two therapies that, well, the one of the two that are the very best, covering the full spectrum of the two, the one that's available now, the best is therapeutic plasma replacement.

And that is removing blood plasma from seniors and replacing with thoroughly screened plasma from donors in their early 20s. And there is a misconception that this is some kind of vampirism stealing the youth away from young people. Actually, there is scientific research I can share with you that shows that this is actually good for the young person as well as the recipient, so it's good for the donor. And there are no ill effects of giving many, many plasma donations over the years. And I can show you a study that demonstrates that.

And there are variations of this. Therapeutic plasma exchange, remove plasma, and replace with saline and albumin. And then also TPI, just an infusion without removal.

So for me, TPE obtained the best objectively measured and subjective results of any age management therapy I've ever had, and I've had a lot. And my expectation is that old plasma out, young plasma in will be even better.

The concept is based on something I think everyone here is familiar with. The circulatory systems of old and young mice were joined. The old mouse got the young blood. The young mouse got the old blood. The old mouse became biologically younger the young mouse became older This is called parabiosis All of you I think are familiar with this The same principle applies in a different way to humans We not going to sew people together but we can do it in different ways.

So, plasma is the liquid part of blood, makes up about 55%. Percent. It contains thousands of components, and some of the main categories are extracellular vesicles or exosomes or acellular nanoparticles, cytokines, growth factors, metabolites, nutrients, and the other things that you can quickly read on the screen here.

Okay, a few of the thousands of components, and let's drill down a little bit to the extracellular vesicles or exosomes. There are many, many categories of these. So this is just a brief description and we're researching and learning more about this all the time.

Okay, a few more examples. Cytokines. Some of them include interferons, tumor necrosis factors, chemokines, etc. Various kinds of growth factors, GDF-11. Many of us are injecting GDF-11. I did some just yesterday, and here is a list of some of the others that are, and many others of all these categories, are contained in young plasma.

Moving along, a few others, hey, guess what? Mitochondria. Tom and I had a conversation and he advised me that if you were to infuse young plasma, plasma from young donors, you would get mitochondria and that would be a good thing.

Thank you, Johnny. Thank you for adding a slide for us. Heck yeah. Hey, I'm a big fan. And for years, in addition to plasma therapies, young plasma, and the other thing that I'm working on, the Yamanaka OSK, both Senolytics and mitochondria, repeat, mitochondria have been on the top of my list of things that are really important. And I've been waiting for you to come along, Tom. So I'm really glad that you're working here. We try to fit it all together. Absolutely. Heck yeah.

More examples of different kinds of things like NAD, CoQ10, and others here, miRNAs, different kinds of hormones, albumin. Albumin is a detoxifying and an antioxidant detoxifying factor and an antioxidant and antibodies, stem cells, progenitor cells.

So now here's one of my take-home points why I'm kind of keen on this. This full range of complementary and balanced components found in plasma from young people would be far more, in my estimation, more effective than one molecule or several in combination. So this balance is consistent with the target we're aiming at, youth.

And there's also evidence that these therapies, that young plasma assists in dementia and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

So donors of the plasma will be thoroughly screened and the plasma will be tested. They'd be tested for genetics, antigens, heavy metals, APOE, spike proteins. There's a big controversy about that going on. We are carefully considering just how carefully we're going to test for spike proteins. And they'll be interviewed, just eyeball to eyeball, and be asked some, well, important questions that impact the quality of the plasma, including lifestyle choices and some other attributes.

So, one therapy, I contend, is like a piccolo player. That's nice. Combinations can be like a string quartet. Isn that sweet Now here something interesting Sometimes the wrong combinations are more like a loud out of tune intoxicated rock band And I think it was Jeff who brought my attention to my attention that there are our bodies go through anabolic and catabolic periods. And if we have therapies that do both, they're kind of button heads.

So So if you want a soundtrack for that, it might sound like this. Pretty awful. So Young Plasma, we're going to test, and I say it's like hundreds of symphonies and choruses in harmony. Here's the Ode to Joy. I am sure that I am, and I do the wrong thing, I'll say me.

All righty, this is so much fun. Also, there's evidence that these therapies assist in dementia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. I guess it kind of sounds like it.

Okay, some scientific published research studies, and here's a list of them. You can get and read these for yourself on the website. It's the first link. And here's another one, reputable. I think these are Stanford and others. Some more, some other ones. There are some critics of some of these studies and how they're conducted. You can read about that and decide for yourself some more research, some more, some more research studies. Tony Wyss-Coray, well, he did a video on it and also did a webinar, and there's a video of that webinar. And also, So even Peter Diamandis is talking about therapeutic plasma exchange these days, and he mentions therapeutic plasma replacement.

So, and I have some other references for you. They're less formal and include some testimonials and anecdotes. And on the publications or things I put up on the website I usually put I very clear to state things that we in process of researching and that this is a research study but also the academic peer research But I have some other things if anyone really interested in this I would share with you that are not academic and high-level peer-reviewed, but still, they contain a certain amount of validity.

These are some team members. Dr. Parita is our medical director and study site physician, And Deborah O'Neill has 30 years experience in plasma and blood banks and labs. She's our operations director, highly experienced.

This is expected to be a profitable business. There's a big old stack of $1,000 bills, okay? And let me tell you, I have skin in this game. I've put a lot of my own money and something that's a lot more precious to me, my own time, into creating the IRB protocol, paying for the IRB, the Investigational Review Board, and getting their approval. This is an IRB-approved clinical study.

And I'm seeking a partnership with someone who's in it for biological age reversal, not only the money. In fact, if you're just in this for money, this won't work. That's, you know, we wouldn't be working together. I could introduce you to some people who are very good at that. Fiona Miller at Quadroscope, for example.

So though this is expected to be a profitable business, if you're like me and have a passion to be biologically young again, this, I say, is the best thing we can do right now. And there'd be a fair return on investment. So you tell me how you'd want it structured, we can work something out. But like me, that should be minor compared to the age reversal effects.

Here's what I want out of it. Surprise, I'm not in it for the money, but I want unlimited use of the therapies at very minimal, basic, hard costs. And being part of this would put you on my personal A-list for other innovative age reversal treatments that some world scientists and I are working on including a Yamanaka OSK therapy which I believe I mentioned If you want to know more about this contact me privately

I need $220,000 maximum to get this going. I could probably do it on less, but I want to make sure I don't have to go back to the well, and I want to have room for expansion. So what you get out of it, unlimited use of the therapies at very minimal cost, some at no cost.

And here's a fact, aging is 100% fatal. Tick tock. These you see on the screen are unacceptable. The one on the left, sick, living in a nursing home, dependent on others, paying all our monies to doctors and hospitals, and eventually the thing on the right, the big sleep. No, thank you. At least we'll put it off as long as we can. I call it open-ended lifespan. Healthy, of course, and making the world a better place because that's an important component of this, but we can talk about that later.

You can't take it with... No, no, you can't. This guy tried. How'd that work out? Not so well.

Okay, so my groups are working on advanced therapies for open-ended life, healthy, of course, and making the world a better place, and you want to be a part of it. So here's what I'm going to do. Mark your calendar 2049 it's my big 100th birthday party and that's where the long-term planning will begin we'll do the things we did when we were young okay we'll dance in the sun dance till sunrise we'll learn a bunch of stuff we'll i don't know jump off cliffs into water there's actually water there. Okay, we'll run a race, we'll hurl a hammer, we'll have a meeting. That's all what we need, more meetings. Long-term planning. We'll have some laughter, joy, and fun.

That baby gets me all right okay you all know how to get a hold of me so any questions that baby gets me all right okay you all know how to get a hold of me so any questions i guess not

# Closing Discussion

Well johnny johnny you mentioned you moved to florida whereabouts are you are you doing this now? Boca Raton, but also we're looking at a presence in Coral Gables, which is just west of Miami. But hell, I'll go anywhere. Also, we're planning on doing this in California, but Florida is a lot friendlier. Plus, the Yamanaka OSK group is centered here, and we're doing some things in Bahamas.

I went to the Heal Inc. conference in the Bahamas and they're doing some innovative things there. And Jamaica and St. Kitts and Nevis are just a hop, skip and a jump away. And we're able to do things offshore there, but then there's also Cobble.

So that's a long answer to a short question. So was there more to that? No, no. Okay. Hey, some of you stayed. All right. All righty. Well, I'm going to turn the recording off. So that's it for now.

# Insights

- **Mitochondria as Primary Aging Driver**: mtDNA damage accumulation (e.g., deletions visualized via sequencing from urine, quantified as % damage scores correlating with lifespan curves) is posited as a root cause of aging, upstream of hallmarks; decline triggers energy deficits leading to diseases like Alzheimer's (impaired waste clearance), glaucoma, sepsis vulnerability; countered by periodic 2-10% replacement to extend to 130+ years.
- **Natural Transfer Mechanisms**: Mitochondria traffic via "mitelets" (platelet-derived extracellular vesicles containing ~5 mt/chondria/platelet, trillions circulating); stem cells selectively donate to senescent cells via tunneling nanotubes; evolutionarily conserved recycling prevents waste, explaining human longevity vs. short-lived mammals.
- **Autologous Bioreactor Purification**: Culture patient stem cells 10,000x in 2000L bioreactors, selectively eliminate damaged mtDNA (proprietary, energy-intensive akin to oogenesis selecting pristine mtDNA for eggs: 300k-500k perfect copies/egg despite maternal damage); coat for immune evasion/targeting (e.g., heart, eye); ~equivalent to 10k stem cell doses.
- **Preclinical Efficacy**: 6% replacement in aged mice boosts sepsis/H1N1 survival (10x cytokine/bacteremia reduction via T-cell recharge), optic nerve migration; no adverse events at therapeutic doses, but overdose clogs lungs.
- **Laptop/Battery Analogy**: Prioritize mt replacement as "new battery" enabling downstream fixes (e.g., epigenetic reprograms nuclear DNA); supplements/red light yield marginal gains vs. genetic refresh.
- **Plasma Synergy**: Young plasma delivers balanced youth factors (exosomes, GDF11, miRNAs, NAD, mitochondria) > isolated molecules; parabiosis-inspired, IRB-approved trials target muscle/cognition/immunity/skin; autologous/allogeneic options, donor screening critical.
- **Trial Design Tricks**: Start 65+ (high dilution signal), exclude cancer/dementia; multi-modal biomarkers (mtDNA score, VO2max, grip strength, skin panels) with exercise controls; Phase 1 dosing escalation from skin tests.
