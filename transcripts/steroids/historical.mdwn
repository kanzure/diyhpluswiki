Organic Chemistry Walkthrough Steroid Total Synthesis: Equilenin, Retrosynthesis, Reaction Mechanism

video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNx41RTXgMY>

LLM-generated summary: This presentation surveys the pre-World War II era of steroid total synthesis, exemplified by Max Bachmann's 1939 synthesis of equilenin, a landmark achievement amid the impracticality of natural isolation from sources like urine (25 L for 15 mg androsterone) or adrenal glands (20,000 cows for 75 mg cortisone). Retrosynthetically, it hinges on Dieckmann cyclization and decarboxylation of a diester precursor, accessed via Arndt-Eistert and Reformatsky homologations from Butenandt's ketone—a tetralone derived from Kleve's acid (8-aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid) through Sandmeyer iodination, Grignard extension, malonate alkylation, and SnCl₄-mediated Friedel-Crafts acylation. The forward sequence employs base-mediated β-ketoester formation, enolate methylation for a quaternary center, non-selective Na/Hg reduction (d.r. ~1:1), selective ester hydrolysis, and ring closure, yielding ~25% from the ketone and underscoring the era's reliance on robust, degradative-proof strategies before post-war innovations in mechanistic planning and novel reactivity.

# Introduction to Pre-WWII Steroid Synthesis

Let's talk about the pre-WWII era of steroid synthesis. This video will serve as an introduction that builds on an undergrad level understanding of chemistry.

After familiarizing ourselves with the early days of steroid synthesis, we will be able to appreciate modern strategies that exemplify more advanced concepts. These future videos will also include stereochemical and mechanistic discussions, which I know a lot of people requested.

I'm leaving for a vacation soon, but I tried to squeeze in this video, so it will be slightly shorter.

The accessibility of steroid hormones is not only important to the muscle head in your local gym, but has been paramount to the elucidation of a wide range of physiological processes in all kinds of animals.

By the 1940s, steroids were one of the hottest targets amongst organic chemists.

# Motivations: Why Synthesize Steroids?

But why did people care about synthesizing steroids after all their natural products, right? Let's look at what situation they were faced with.

Firstly, the actual procedure of isolating steroids from natural sources were tedious to say the least. This involved a load of extractions, concentrations, distillations, columns and repeatedly playing around with pH values.

Developing a procedure and analyzing your extracts and fractions consisted of injecting them into a castrated rooster to see whether this led to high growth promoting effects on its red crest.

I've personally visited an industrial large-scale natural product isolation plant and oh dear is it a lengthy process.

Let's say you were totally cool with isolating steroids from nature. Well go ahead and take a look at the required scale and your very practical yields.

# Examples of Isolation Challenges

The German biochemist and Nobel laureate Adolf Butenandt first isolated the steroid androsterone in 1931. To obtain 15 mg of crystalline material he had to process 25 liters of urine.

Similarly ridiculous amounts of materials were required for other steroids as well. To put these numbers into perspective, the isolation of 75 mg of cortisone required adrenal glands from 20,000 cows.

# Aside: Periplanone B Isolation

Because we're already talking about insane natural product isolations, I want to quickly mention my favorite one, the cockroach pheromone periplanone B.

After seven years of work, 200 micrograms were isolated from 75,000 female virgin cockroaches. It's a really potent pheromone though, as femtogram quantities are sufficient to send male cockroaches into a sexual frenzy.

The total synthesis of periplanone B by Clark Still in 1979 is a classic that some of you probably have heard about already.

# The Imperative for Total Synthesis

So, now that we've established that unless you want to take out a whole farm or collect a small country's worth of urine to get your hands on some steroids, we need to make them synthetically.

# Historical Context of Total Synthesis

Before we dive into this video's synthesis, let me give you some more context first. This synthesis for some people constitutes the end of the pre-World War II era in organic chemistry.

Up to this point, total syntheses were closely tied to structural proof, so chemists employed robust reactions without very creative design. This notion soon changed after the Second World War.

The isolation of more complex natural products and insights into mechanistic organic chemistry catalyzed the development of novel reactions and strategies. In turn, it was possible to plan longer and more sophisticated sequences.

# Bachmann's Synthesis of Equilenin (1939): Retrosynthesis

Let's take a look at the first total synthesis of a steroid and one of the most complex natural product syntheses at that point, the Bachmann synthesis of equilenin from 1939.

Bachmann employed a structure retrosynthetic strategy. By choosing this known ketone as a starting material basically all he had to do was to introduce a methyl group and to fuse one additional ring to complete the steroid nucleus.

To this end, he envisioned a Dieckmann cyclization and decarboxylation process starting from this diester.

To connect this intermediate to the known ketone, two carbon homologations had to be incorporated. One of them was accomplished by employing the recently discovered Arndt-Eistert homologation.

The other homologation consisted of a Reformatsky reaction-dehydration-reduction sequence.

The use of this beta-keto acid as an intermediate allowed for facile construction of the quaternary center via enolate chemistry.

# Preparation of the Starting Ketone: Butenandt's Ketone

Let's take a look at the forward synthesis and how the so-called Butenandt's ketone can be accessed.

The preparation commenced with hydrolysis of this naphthalamine sulfonic acid called Kleve's acid. Subsequent acetylation of the amine, methylation of the naphthol and deacetylation of the amine gave the mono-protected amine.

There will be another cool play around with protecting groups in the synthesis later on.

# Sandmeyer Reaction to Aryl Iodide

Nucleophilic substitution of the corresponding diazo species in a Sandmeyer reaction gave this aryl iodide.

The Sandmeyer reaction is quite interesting. With chloride, bromide or cyanide nucleophiles, it requires copper(I) catalysis and proceeds with a radical mechanism.

Employing iodide as a nucleophile doesn't require copper catalysis and is quasi-autocatalyzed, if you will. The mechanism is a bit more complicated, but that's the reason why we're using potassium iodide and not a copper source.

There are modern variants of this reaction that enable, for example, the trifluoromethylation of arenes, so it's quite useful.

# Chain Extension: Grignard, Malonate, and Friedel-Crafts

The aryl iodide Grignard reagent was reacted with ethylene oxide and the resulting alcohol converted to the bromide.

Substitution with diethyl malonate, decarboxylation and chlorination gave the acyl chloride which was subjected to a Friedel-Crafts acylation similar to the Woodward synthesis of lysergic acid we've talked about last time.

This time, tin tetrachloride is the Lewis acid of choice.

So now that we've arrived at our ketone starting material, let's start the actual synthesis of equilenin.

# Beta-Ketoacid Formation and Quaternary Center

The ketone was converted to the beta-ketoacid via reaction with methyl oxalate and pyrolysis to eliminate carbon monoxide.

Nowadays, one would just use an activated form of methyl carbonate.

A simple methylation installed the quaternary center.

# First Homologation: Reformatsky Sequence

Reformatsky reaction, elimination, ester hydrolysis and reduction with sodium amalgam resulted in the first homologation.

The d.r. of this reduction was about 1 to 1, so diastereoselectivity in this synthesis was not a problem, but not really thoroughly planned either.

# Second Homologation: Arndt-Eistert Preparation

Now, methylation of both free acids and selective hydrolysis of the less hindered ester set the stage for the Arndt-Eistert reaction.

If you haven't heard of this reaction already, try to come up with a mechanism for this three-step process.

# Dieckmann Cyclization and Completion

To conclude the synthesis, ensuing Dieckmann condensation forged a five-membered D-ring and the final decarboxylation gave equilenin.

According to Bachmann, about one gram of equilenin could be obtained per four grams of Butenandt's ketone, so it's quite a scalable process.

# Outlook to Modern Syntheses

Now that we've covered this fundamental work, we can look forward to contrasting it to post-WWII era syntheses such as the work of William Johnson and even latest research.

For example, there's some recently published work that employs a modern methodology related to steroid synthesis that I'd like to cover in a future video.

Actually, quite a few high-caliber total syntheses have been published very recently, so I'm very excited.
