* The importance of regulatory sandboxes (which should be optional).

* Permissionless innovation

* Users should opt-in to consumer protection tools.

* Regulatory compliance should be optional, but not required.

* Regulators should promote high quality businesses and products that follow good standards, and de-escalate scams and insecure companies.

* The benefits of verifiable credentials

* It is very unclear whether these regulators have really engaged Bitcoin Core developers. I keep very extensive notes, and there's very few workshops like this. So where are these regulators getting their information from? Open sessions are required.

* Backdoors are security holes, third-parties are security holes. You may trust your government with your backdoor, but do you trust all the future political groups that might have control of that system?

* provenance of the supply chain of the source code, and toolchain building (guix and deterministic builds)
