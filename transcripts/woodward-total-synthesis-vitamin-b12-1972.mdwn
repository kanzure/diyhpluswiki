LLM-generated summary: Robert B. Woodward's 1972 Harvard lecture details the total synthesis of cobyrinic acid (a key precursor to vitamin B12), achieved through close collaboration with Albert Eschenmoser's group in Zurich. The corrin macrocycle, featuring nine chiral centers and a central cobalt, posed immense stereochemical challenges, addressed via absolute asymmetric synthesis of optically active AD, BC fragments, and precise differentiation of side chains. Key innovations include constructing the AD fragment from β-coronosterone (six contiguous chiral centers confirmed by X-ray), regioselective lactam opening with thiols/methanol to enable thioester differentiation post-ozonolysis, sulfur-bridged coupling of AD/BC halves followed by phosphine-mediated desulfurization to form the critical C-D and A-B bonds, thiolactone activation for clean ring openings, zinc-mediated oxidative cyclization, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for resolving all eight diastereomers at labile C3/C8/C13 centers (favoring natural α-configurations). Cobalt insertion using CoCl₂/THF and strategic oxidations yielded the pentamethyl ester of bis-norcobyrinic acid, completing the ABCD corrin nucleus with correct stereochemistry and functionality.

# Introduction by David Dolphin

As you know, it's traditional here at Harvard that when a member of our own faculty gives a talk, he's not introduced. But let me dispel any illusions you may have. I'm not Woodward. I've decided that it's time the traditions of Harvard were changed slightly, and that maybe this would be a good opportunity to continue the tradition that we have started in this year's Organic Colloquium of introducing our own members.

If I appear nervous, I am. I feel a little like the man who, knowing that he shouldn't have accepted the invitation to a party, went nevertheless and finds that horrible moment is about to occur when he's got to introduce his mistress to his wife.

My standing here all began about a month ago, I guess, when, as always, I was having lunch with John Osborn, whom I introduced about a year ago. And he said, well, Dave, you did such a good job on me. Why didn't you try one on Woodward? And I thought, no, I've had enough temptations this month. My wife has been away. I've had enough.

I was persuaded, however, that perhaps I should try my hand at an introduction. I'm regretting every minute of it now. I'm not sure how one can possibly introduce somebody as well-known as Professor Woodward. What can I say that you don't know? Very little.

# Woodward's Achievements and Early Career

I thought I would start out by giving you the facts. One cannot go too badly wrong with the facts. And then when we have the facts, we see what we can develop from there.

Professor Woodward's career began many years ago at MIT. It was quite clear from his original scientific endeavors that here was somebody who was going to go far.

[Slide shown: Early paper]

It's been downhill ever since.

The next slide lists some of the other papers which you may or may not be familiar with. I don't want to bore you with the details. I'm sure you're as familiar with them as I am. Synthesis of quinine in '44. Oh, interesting one. The structure of ferrocene may not be as familiar to you as it is at least to me.

The next slide shows the structure that Professor Woodward in fact suggested for ferrocene. It's rather interesting how these things develop historically, and one might actually use the analogy with August Kekulé when he composed the structure for benzene.

# Kekulé's Dream and Ferrocene Analogy

Now, I have here in front of me a description of Kekulé's dream and since he wrote it, I assume it must be true. It isn't, however, the story that I heard. The story I heard was that, in fact, Kekulé had a dream on top of a London bus. London buses are great places. There are many exciting things that can happen in a man's life on the top of a London bus. I was convinced when I was told the story that in fact this was the location for Kekulé's structural thoughts about benzene, but it turns out not.

Let me, before we come to ferrocene, just read what Kekulé wrote. When did he write it? 1865. This remember was forty years before the advent of Freud. "There I sat and wrote my Lehrbuch but did not proceed well. My mind was elsewhere. I turned the chair to the fireplace and fell half asleep. Again, the atoms gambled before my eyes. Smaller groups this time kept modestly to the background. My mind's eye, trained by repeated visions of a smaller kind, now distinguished larger formations of various shapes. Long rows, in many ways more densely joined, everything in movement, winding and turning like snakes. And look, what was that? One snake grabbed its own tail." That's where Freud comes in. "And mockingly the shape whirled before my eyes. As if struck by lightning, I awoke. This time, I again spent the rest of the night to work out the consequences, the consequences of which were, of course, the structure which we now accept for benzene."

I'd like to sit back and think for a moment. If Kekulé was thinking about snakes biting their tails when he postulated the structure for benzene, what do you think Professor Woodward was thinking about when he had this symmetric structure in mind?

[Slide: Later syntheses]

Well, we go through syntheses of terpenes, steroids, chlorophyll, tetracyclines, structural elucidation of tetrodotoxin, cephalosporin, orbital symmetry. And as you know tonight, we're going to hear about the total synthesis of B12.

# Collaborators and Horoscope

It's said, however, that you can judge a man by the company he keeps. And I asked Miss Dyer, I think early this week actually, if she could provide me with a list of the collaborators who have worked with Professor Woodward. It's a very long one, over 300 names, and as much as I would like to outline them all in detail, and I trust those that I've left out won't feel particularly unhappy if they're sitting in the audience, I decided to simply go through this list and pick every fifth one and just let you see what sort of names one came up with.

[Slide: Selected names]

You can imagine what the other 250 look like. It's inevitable of course in making a list in this random fashion that you're bound to miss one or two of the more important collaborators.

[Slide: Key collaborators]

I trust that many of you were here for the Tachikawa lecture, which Professor Eschenmoser gave some few weeks ago. You may recall at that time that the introduction was in fact given by tonight's speaker. And much of the introduction concerned itself with a horoscope that Professor Eschenmoser had had prepared for him. And I understand that Professor Woodward took some delight in discussing this in great detail. You may remember that the young lady in question who had prepared this horoscope suggested that Dr. Woodward himself might like a horoscope prepared.

The unfortunate thing about having a horoscope prepared is that you need to know exactly when you were born. It's no good knowing the day or the year or even the week, let alone the hour. You need the minute. And Woodward's suggestion, I guess, to this young lady was that she should simply prepare a horoscope for each minute of the day, and we could then find out which particular minute he was born in.

# Birth Records and Horoscope Details

Well, I've never quite had the financial resources to carry out my research the way Professor Woodward has, and I thought that if we were going to do anything about this, we would have to go about it in a more systematic fashion.

Well, the course I pursued was this. Went to Who's Who, first of all, to make sure he was born. Here he was. He was born in Boston. Now, that has some advantages in this country. Boston's an old city, wrong traditions, keeps records. So I went to the State House to see what they knew about our speaker. They confirmed his date of birth. That's all they had. That really doesn't help us. Everybody knows what that date is. But they had one little bit of information, which I thought might possibly help. And that is that he was born in the Boston Lying-In Hospital, which, you know is one of our more renowned hospitals in the area.

I phoned the hospital up and asked them if they would keep these sort of records. They said, oh sure, we have records going back to 1620. Who do you want? So they said, just send us a letter and a two dollar search fee and we'll see what we can do. What they did is shown on the next slide, I hope. Yeah, that's the. I've typed underneath it the information in case you can't read the writing. "In regard to your request, the exact time of Professor Woodward's birth was at 3:39 a.m."

This is authentic, this is no... It's a very interesting time actually, half past three. It obviously set an example to him because it's my understanding that in fact Professor Woodward only sleeps about three hours a day anyhow, goes to bed at one and gets up to half past three. I guess he started that way and just couldn't change his habits.

But anyhow, with this information at hand, knowing exactly where he was born, room 21 in the Boston Lying-In Hospital, and knowing exactly when he was born, I transmitted this information to Zurich, to Professor Eschenmoser, who is sitting in the audience today, and he flew in today with a very interesting document.

Since the only thing I have to lose is my job and my friends and my reputation, I thought I might read some of it to you. Now, as I say, I only saw this horoscope two or three hours ago, so if I'm a little slow in translating some of the rather unusual symbols I trust you bear with me.

[Slide: Horoscope chart]

The next slide in fact shows the horoscope that was prepared. Now this probably means more to you than it does to me. Let me see what my crib says. OK, it seems that this line here, labeled AC, is the ascendant line. And it's this line which tells you very much about all the social behavior and one's personal life. Whereas this MC line, essentially orthogonal, is the line which details and outlines one's professional career.

Your favorite color is red.

The only disadvantage in lecturing at one's own institution is that you don't get an honorarium. However, Professor Eschenmoser assures me that the young lady who prepared this horoscope is anxious to meet Professor Woodward once again. And although we can't provide you with an honorarium, we might at least provide you with an opportunity.

You'll appreciate in a document as delicate and sensitive as this that I'm going to have to not only read between the lines but leave some of the lines out. But if you'd like to come by my office tomorrow and get some more of the details, I guess I can let you in on some of the secrets.

Let me be absolutely honest about this. This is a true horoscope we've had prepared. The young lady who prepared the horoscope knew nothing about the individual for whom it was prepared, other than when and where he was born. I must say, until this time, I believed as much in horoscopes as I do in half the papers I read in JACS recently.

But it seems that the way you work out one of these things once you know when the man is born is you see what particular planets and heavenly bodies come into conjunction for any particular aspect of the man's life. And the woman who prepared this horoscope said that it really is a unique horoscope, the most unusual individual about whom it's written.

It appears that one can divide many of these subjects we're going to discuss into various subsections. The first one is fire. And it says that in this heading, fire, the sun and Mars and Venus all in conjunction, and that the individual must be highly dedicated, forceful, energetic, and determined.

The moon dominates water, a man of great sentiment. In Earth, it's Mercury that's in the ascendance, a good practical sense. Under air, it appears everything is missing. Conclusion is that the man is not diplomatic, and he impresses others with his own views and viewpoints.

Now, remember that we really did not give any other additional information. Clearly this man should be a scientist. More than that, Pluto influences his personality, and he should be a chemist. Now there's a challenge for you.

Apparently once we've gone through the air, earth, sun, and the moon, whatever it is, we then have these various houses, each of which covers a particular aspect of the individual's personality.

# Horoscope: Personality, Wealth, and Habits

The first house deals with the man's personality. Very sensitive, sentimental, and as a result of his dynamic personality, he's quite attractive to the opposite sex. You mean you don't believe it either?

The second house has to deal with money and possessions. The young lady would estimate that the man must be very rich. She might almost say filthy rich. And his money comes from two principal sources. One is his own profession, and the other is a unique gift for taking advantage of a situation and jumping in at just the right time. It also outlines in some detail here where his money goes, but I think that's one of those sections I'm going to keep closed until later.

The third house deals with the heading that says small intellectual matters, items related to his professional activities and such like. It says no special hobbies were noted, but the man is an exceedingly good driver. Probably true. Have you seen Professor Woodward's new car? It's a 4.5 liter super deluxe Mercedes-Benz. It has everything you could need in a car: air conditioning, stereo speakers, back seat that pulls out to a bed. It even has a console that plugs directly into E.J. Corey's synthetic computer.

Let's go past the fourth house. It's not especially exciting at the moment.

Fifth house deals with love and sex. I think there you and I, Bob, are going to have to have a quiet talk after the lecture.

House 6 deals with work, health, illness. It says that the man about whom this horoscope is written has a strong attraction to nicotine, liquor, and drugs of all kinds. However, the man has such a strong character that none of these above mentioned will affect his health in any adverse way. I think I'd better miss that one as well.

In the 10th house, which deals with his professional life, it says the man will have an excellent reputation in his chosen profession, that he will fulfill all the professional goals that he sets himself, and that probably, and this is an interesting statement, probably this career began when he was about 22. It's off a little, but not all our careers start at 22.

# Bibliographic Notes and Personal Anecdotes

And I thought I might just read you some bibliographic information concerning Professor Woodward. This is taken from the book The Importance of Antibonding Orbitals, and it's chapter 5, which is headed the Hoffmann-Woodward Wars. I rather wish in a way that I was introducing Hoffmann.

You may have heard some time ago, when Hoffmann was being introduced by Osterhoff, that Osterhoff stood up and said, there have been in the history of organic chemistry a number of very eminent Hoffmanns, the one associated with the elimination and the rearrangement and the degradation. He said that the most famous Hoffmann of them all is the one whose first name is Woodward.

Anyhow, this bibliographical information says, Robert Woodward was born in 1917 in Boston, Massachusetts. He flunked out of Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an organic chemistry student in his sophomore year, was given a second chance and received his B.Sc. from that institution in '39, and by the age of 20, he had received his Ph.D., and has ever since been at Harvard.

I think I leave the remainder of this horoscope until the party afterwards and just detail some of the things that I have learned while I've been here. I guess I came here towards the end of 1965 to spend a postdoctoral year with Woodward and he introduced me into a number of new and delightful concepts. A 14-hour day, a 7-day week, and one for which I should be ever thankful and that is the daiquiri.

Daiquiri is a sheer delight and there's only one place I've found in Boston where you can get a really good daiquiri and that's the Faculty Club. And there's only one man at the Faculty Club that can make a really good daiquiri and that's Denny.

[Denny prepares daiquiris onstage]

We're ready, Denny. Go to the front. Just here. I'll get it out. I'll get it out. You got it? Yeah. I guess we really don't need this, so perhaps I'll have some more.

The daiquiri is a very unpretentious drink. It's basically rum with a bit of sugar and lime. It's the sugar in case you need it. While Denny's making our daiquiri, I'd just like to take a few moments. Professor Woodward's graduate students and postdoctoral fellows asked me, they said, for three years we've been trying to get hold of him, do you think tonight you might possibly be able to give him this present. They also insist that you should open it now.

[Gift presentation]

You mean now? Now. Take your time. I don't want to interrupt going on here. The document here. A document which states, presented 27-11-1972 to Professor R. B. Woodward on the occasion of the presentation at Harvard of the total synthesis of vitamin B12, and it is signed by all of the members of my research group. And it is a very lovely object. Thank you.

How's it going, Denny? No, no, you just carry on making it. Just kidding.

Professor Woodward's mother was a Scot. I guess one can never quite escape one's roots. You really should. I was just making sure that it was up to the usual standard. Why don't you take one [daiquiri] at present.

Professor Woodward's mother was a Scot and I don't want this to sound a gauche cliché, but for many years, the Scottish poet Robert Burns, whom I assume must have been a favorite of Mrs. Woodward, has long been a favorite of mine. And there's one particular poem of Robert Burns that has long attracted me. It's called The Dean o' Faculty. It's a new ballad, it says, and it's supposed to be sung to the tune The Dragon of Wantley.

Well, my social attributes don't go to singing, especially when I don't know the tune. But I thought I might possibly just read two verses. It's showing the balances and the counterbalances that one might anticipate in a university. It involves two principal characters, Harlaw and Langside. And somewhere there comes in beauteous, hapless Mary. I'm not sure where she fits in, but I guess this is just the old triangle. It's part of the way things go. And this poem is outlining just the way one has to get involved in the infighting in a university if you want to survive.

[Reads verses]

Dire was the hate at old Harlaw that Scot to Scot did carry, and dire the discord Langside saw for beauteous, hapless Mary. But Scot with Scot ne'er met so hot, or more in fury seen, sir, than twixt Hal and Bob for the famous job, who should be faculty's dean, sir?

This howl for genius, wit, and law, amongst the first was numbered. But pious Bob, mid's learning store, commandment the tenth remembered. Yet simple Bob the victory got and won his heart's desire, which shows that heaven can boil the pot though the devil piss in the fire.

We're approaching that time in the evening when the real entertainment begins. Are you almost finished? Almost. Okay. Do you still need some sugar? You heard her.

# Closing the Introduction

And there's always a problem when one is introducing a man. The problem is that, you know, it may be that people in the audience really don't know who I'm talking about. There's, of course, a simple way of overcoming that. To show you a picture of the man.

[Slide: Photo]

Let's have the next slide. I think you should take the lights out and focus it. That's better, that's better. Now, lest you be misled again, the man on the left is Pfizer, not Woodward. This is Woodward, here. Rather than let your imaginations run riot, I'll show you in fact what he's really doing.

[Final slide]

Well, I think it's time for the real evening's business. This evening is entitled The Total Synthesis of Vitamin B12. Professor Woodward.

# Woodward's Opening Remarks

Thank you David for that very fulsome introduction, and for having been the moving factor in making it possible for me at long last to speak here at Harvard.

Now, I should like to say first that the acoustical properties of this room are notoriously bad, and consequently, should I become so absorbed in what I am discussing that my voice falls to the point that you can't hear, I strongly urge you to shout louder. I shall be not in the least offended if you do that, because I do tend to get interested in what I'm talking about, and my voice falls as I become more and more interested. So please don't hesitate to make it known if you can't hear.

Now I'm glad that David has set a relatively leisurely pace for this evening's proceedings. Some weeks ago I was in London and I learned that there was being shown there the entire 26 hours of the Forsyte Saga series right in consecutive way. That is, people went to a theater and they stayed there for 26 hours while the whole television series, which I'm sure many of you have seen, was played through. I saw a number of them interviewed on television and they said that they stayed awake throughout the whole thing.

Now presented with an opportunity to speak about the total synthesis of vitamin B12, one is presented at the same time with something of a problem. The investigation which has culminated in the synthesis of vitamin B12 is a very long one, very formidable one. It has led to the establishment of a straight path from carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and cobalt to vitamin B12. It has led to many bypass and offshoots, and indeed were the whole story to be told, the 26-hour Forsyte Saga would more nearly resemble one of those delightful Japanese verses, a haiku, I think, with a few syllables, than the synthesis of vitamin B12. That'd be a lot more complicated and take longer.

And so one has to make a choice if we're to get away from here. I was going to say at a reasonable time, you're not going to get away at a reasonable time, but let's say in a relatively short time.

# Collaboration and Scope

Now, I should also, at the outset, like to say and emphasize that the work which I shall describe is a joint effort carried out under what might loosely be called the leadership of myself here in Cambridge, and Professor Albert Eschenmoser in Zurich. And we worked, the two groups, Cambridge and Zurich, worked very, very closely together. I don't think I know of any occasion of such close collaboration in which even samples were sent back and forth, reactions were started in one city and finished in the other. It was a very very close fruitful cordial indeed extremely pleasant collaboration.

And it's a very great privilege for me tonight here to be able to be the spokesman for both of these groups, the group in Zurich associated with Professor Eschenmoser, and the group here in Cambridge loosely associated with myself.

# Structure of Vitamin B12

Now, let us first, let's have the first slide.

[Slide: B12 structure]

And we need some focusing. That's pretty good, Olien. A bit better, and perhaps a bit less light. How about that? Can almost everyone see it? There's a substantial number that can't. Would they shout? Either you can or you don't like to shout. All right, now there is in all its magnificence the structure of vitamin B12, lovely structure, established in the 1950s essentially entirely through the beautiful x-ray crystallographic work of Dorothy Hodgkin at Oxford.

Speaking generally, it is certainly the most complicated of the non-macromolecular natural products. You will see that it has this somewhat unusual macrocyclic system with a cobalt atom embedded in the middle of it, four five-membered heterocyclic rings forming that one large macrocyclic ring. There's an interesting and until vitamin B12 was discovered unique conjugated system running from one of the nitrogen atoms around this internal 16-membered ring to the other nitrogen atom.

You will discern in this structure certain similarities to other very important natural substances. Heme, the active portion or an active portion of the blood pigment is a porphyrin which has a somewhat similar macrocyclic structure with four five-membered nitrogen-containing rings. In that case, rather than rings A and D here being joined by a single bond, they're joined by one carbon atom. There's a bridging carbon atom just as there is at the other three sites in this structure. And then there's chlorophyll, which is constructed very similarly. Again, one of these macrocyclic rings made up of four five-membered nitrogen-containing rings. And in the case of chlorophyll, the leaf pigment, there is in the center a metal atom, magnesium. In the blood pigment, there was the metal atom, iron and here in vitamin B12 cobalt.

# Stereochemical Challenge

Now the thing that strikes one immediately about vitamin B12 is the stereochemical situation. In the case of heme, the blood pigment, the entire macrocyclic nucleus is made up of trigonal carbon atoms and there is no stereochemical problem at all. In the case of chlorophyll, there's a relatively trivial stereochemical problem in that the outer periphery of one of the five-membered rings, corresponding to this position in the vitamin B12 molecule, is reduced so that there are two adjacent chiral centers. But that's a relatively small stereochemical problem.

Now contrast that situation or those situations with that which obtains here in the case of vitamin B12 where this macrocyclic nucleus contains no less than nine chiral centers shown here with stars.

Now obviously the molecule then the structure, presented a challenge and an opportunity to the synthetic chemist to test his methods of constructing molecules in a stereochemically oriented way, in a particular stereochemically oriented way, to test the principles that he knew and perhaps to develop new ones. So that much of the interest in this problem devolves from the stereochemical content, its stereochemical content.

I will mention only briefly that you can see right away that the chiral centers within the large nucleus are very differently distributed. They can be divided essentially into three groups. You see here in ring C there's an isolated one all by itself, quite far away from any of the others. Here in ring B there are two adjacent ones, two close together, and far removed from the one in ring C, and also far removed from this very different group of six contiguous asymmetric atoms.

So that you could say at the outset, and we did say at the outset, that we would have to approach the problem in a stereochemical sense in the following way, that we could not see, we would like to have been able to, but we could not see any way in which we could influence asymmetry, let's say, at this point, by asymmetry already present at a point over here, far away from the initial one.

So that we had to use here what one should call the principle of absolute asymmetric synthesis that is we should have to prepare components representing let us say ring C in the optically active form and of the correct configuration in the sense of corresponding to the natural absolute configuration.

And likewise for the ring B portion we should have to have an optically active building block of some kind in which the relative configurations at the two centers was that desired, and in which the absolute configuration of the optically active building block was that desired.

And then finally, for this third complicated group of six contiguous centers, we should have to have some kind of building block, again optically active in the right absolute configuration, and of course with the right relative configurations with respect to each other, that is the six atoms in this chain.

Now, of course, in the vitamin B12 molecule there are other asymmetric centers. There are five others. There's one here, here, here, and here. Now, I'm not paying very much attention to those for a reason that you'll see in a moment.

You will observe that the periphery of this molecule is adorned by various what you might call acidic chains. There are four propionamide chains, one there, one there, one there, and one here. There are three acetamide chains there, there, and there. You'll notice that one of the propionamide chains is different from all the others in that rather than terminating in a simple amino group, there is this rather complicated chain of rather biochemically familiar groupings. This is an isopropanolamine grouping, phosphate, ribose, dimethylbenzimidazole. That whole chain then is attached at one of the propionic acid termini and then bonds back to the cobalt.

# Target Simplification: Cobyrinic Acid

Now the ribose and the propanolamine portions of that chain they are well substances available readily in optically active form. And so there no trouble in introducing them.

[Next slide]

And if we may have the next slide you will see that the problem of synthesis for Professor Eschenmoser and myself was simplified right at the start by the facts which I've summarized here. The portion in red is that portion that I've just referred to, the isopropanolamine phosphate ribose dimethylbenzimidazole chain attached to this propionamide grouping, itself attached to ring D.

Now that whole chain can be removed and be taken off to give an acid, this acid, that we just have OH in place of this entire chain. And the substance obtained when that chain is removed is a well-known substance, cobyrinic acid or factor V1a. It, like vitamin B12 itself, is a natural product and beyond that it can be obtained by degradation of vitamin B12. Beyond that, cobyrinic acid has very readily been reconverted to vitamin B12 by the addition of this isopropanolamine phosphate ribose dimethylbenzimidazole chain.

And so our task already at the outset had been simplified to that of the synthesis of cobyrinic acid.

# AD Fragment: β-Coronosterone

Now may I have the next slide. What I've said hitherto has been introductory and the lecture proper now begins and this may seem a peculiar place to begin the lecture on the synthesis of vitamin B12. Why have I started with this slide. Well, one reason is that I like the slide very much. Now, what is it?

It is the result, or it summarizes the result, results, of a single crystal, three-dimensional X-ray crystallographic structure determination carried out by Miss Barbara Kaschig, now Mrs. Ernie Hammond, and Professor Jack Gougoutas on a substance called β-coronosterone.

And you will observe in this three-dimensional or the two-dimensional representation of this X-ray structure determination, six blue dots. One, two, three, four, five, six. My favorite color is not red.

Now, those six blue dots represent asymmetric carbon atoms or chiral centers, and indeed, in this molecule of coronosterone, they represent the six contiguous asymmetric centers in the AD portion of the vitamin B12 molecule.

[Next slide]

And so now, if we may have the next slide, we see, shown in a two-dimensional and perhaps more easily recognizable form, β-coronosterone.

Now, you see, it is a tetracyclic substance, a six-membered, five-membered, six-membered, five-membered ring. The name is mildly amusing, or at least I meant it to be so. The "cor" was hopeful. We were hoping that this was going to be an important intermediate in the preparation of some corrins. The "norsterone" refers to the fact that this tetracyclic nucleus is that of a norsteroid if of course we ignore for the moment the presence in the skeleton of two nitrogen atoms one here and one here. And then finally if you pronounce this name in Slavonian it comes out to be something like "cornerstone", which is what we hoped it would be.

Well now, β-coronosterone was prepared by a sequence of some 32 steps or so. What you count as a step in synthetic operations of this sort is rather difficult to define. There are certainly more than 32 transition states involved. But in any event, through a fairly long but very efficient sequence, this β-coronosterone was prepared, and it does contain the six contiguous asymmetric centers in rings A and D of the vitamin B12 molecule. There they are, one, this is ring A, one, two, three, four, five, six. And they are all oriented relative to one another in precisely the way that they are in the vitamin B12 molecule.

Now the dotted arrow here represents a hypothetical transformation in which this six-membered lactam ring is cleaved by methanol. And over here, then we've swung, this is not a chemical change, but just a geometrical movement, we've swung that bottom ring round over to this. There's the methanol, the hydrogen, and the methoxyl. And there now you see rings A and D, and on the right this representation of this open form, hypothetical open form, of coronosterone shows more clearly, I think, that this is a substance which might very well serve for the introduction into a more complicated molecule of the AD portion of the coronosterone of the vitamin B12 molecule.

And as I said I'm going to start with coronosterone not because I really wouldn't like to tell the whole story up to coronosterone, but because there simply wouldn't be time to do it. And the work leading to coronosterone is fairly well described in these earlier publications, which represent lectures which I or Professor Eschenmoser gave from time to time during the course of the work.

I would mention that it was in the course of the sequence of steps leading to coronosterone, that the phenomena were observed which led directly to the principle of orbital symmetry conservation. And this, I think, is perhaps the most dramatic case of the influence of work on natural products on general chemical principles.

# Opening Coronosterone: Hesperamine

Now I said that the representation or the relationship between these two structures shown here is hypothetical. That lactam ring cannot simply be opened by methanol to give this product. It's much too stable a lactam ring and a product of this kind would immediately re-lactamize.

However, a very closely related change can, in fact, be carried out, and that is shown on the next slide.

[Slide]

Now, there again, on the left, you see our coronosterone, and what I've shown here at the top is the result of the treatment of coronosterone with methanolic hydrogen chloride, and the lactam ring is indeed cleaved in the way which I showed as a hypothetical process before.

The difference here is that the resulting β-amino α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system does not survive but rather is transformed into this new system this system which is methylated on oxygen you see a methoxy unsaturated imine system. There is no free hydrogen on this nitrogen, and that effectively blocks the relactamization.

And so if you just turn again, carry out this non-chemical but just spatial operation, the product of this action of methanolic hydrogen chloride on β-coronosterone is hesperamine, which is a stable, open substance showing the AD with the six asymmetric carbon atoms.

And furthermore, I might take this opportunity to point out that hesperamine has chains attached at various places to ring A, for example, which are very reminiscent of those in vitamin B12 itself. These two methyl groups, for example, here attached to ring A are present in the ring A, and we have an acetic chain and a propionic chain.

Now as far as ring D is concerned, the opening of the lactam ring of coronosterone gave us one more acetic acid chain. And then, of course, we have this ring which clearly permits, or at least allows one to think of, a cleavage of this carbon-carbon double bond to give another propionic chain. And, of course, ring D in vitamin B12 does bear a methyl group at this position, an acetic chain, and a propionic chain.

# Differentiation Challenge in Hesperamine

Now as such, however, and this was a very important point, hesperamine was not particularly promising intermediate for vitamin B12 synthesis. And you can see in an instant why, namely, I've directed attention to these various chains, it is true that the substance hesperamine can be converted by ozonization with cleavage of this carbon-carbon double bond to an aldehydo ester of this structure.

But now notice the dilemma which is created thereby. That is that we have a carbomethoxyl group here, here, here, and here. And you may remember now, if you think back to the structure I showed you originally for vitamin B12 itself, and for our immediate objective, cobyrinic acid, this chain attached to ring D must in some way be differentiated from the other chains. This is the point this is the terminus at which that isopropanolamine chain is attached in the vitamin B12 molecule. And clearly we don't want an ester group at this point. At the same time we have ester groups at these other points.

So that hesperamine could serve only as a model substance for subsequent studies. And we had to find some way of differentiating that particular propionic acid terminus from the others present.

# Thio-Differentiation Strategy

Now, the key as to how that might be done came from some spectroscopic studies on coronosterone, which are shown on the next slide. There at the top, again, you see coronosterone.

And one of the things about coronosterone which is very characteristic is the very high reactivity of this carbonyl group. You see, it's an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group. Ordinarily, such groupings are relatively unreactive, but this is a very unusual one in that it has an acylamino group in the β position, which might be expected to make it resemble to some extent a diacylamine.

And that seems to be borne out by the properties of coronosterone, which does have a relatively reactive ketonic carbonyl group at this point. And among other derivatives which can be made from coronosterone is this hemithioacetal from thioethanol, where there is a sulfur and oxygen atom attached where the carbonyl group had been.

Now, we found that when this hemithioacetal, sorry, that's not a hemithioacetal, I can't even remember the name of it. But you can see what it is. It has an oxygen on a sulfur. I guess it is a hemithioacetal. That's right. In any event when this hemithioacetal was treated in methylene chloride with trifluoroacetic acid a very remarkable spectroscopic change occurred. A new absorption band at a very long wavelength, 388 millimicrons, appeared.

Now our studies of various model compounds related to coronosterone enabled us to identify the chromophore which must be associated with this new absorption at 388 millimicrons, as that shown here on the lower left, in which we have observed cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond, freeing a hydroxyl group and leaving the sulfur attached to the six-membered ring.

Now, we also knew from model studies that had the alternative process occurred, that is, that involving cleavage of the carbon-sulfur bond we should have obtained, rather than this sulfonium species, an oxonium species having the structure shown on the right. We knew from our previous studies that this should absorb at 325 millimicrons, and in fact, when the hemithioacetal was treated with acid. There was no trace of absorption at 325 millimicrons, only at this very long wavelength, 388 millimicrons.

Now this gave us basis for hope that we should be able to effect cleavage of the six-membered lactam ring by methanol, while at the same time introducing sulfur at the position where the ketonic carbonyl group had been.

And thus, that turned out to be the case, as we see on the next slide. When coronosterone, under acidic conditions, is treated with mixtures of methanol and various thiols, two changes take place. The methanol cleaves the lactam ring generating a carbomethoxyl group. The mercaptan becomes attached at the carbonyl carbon and gives a alkylthio α,β-unsaturated imine system.

And again, if we turn this structure around, this axis, we now have this situation where again you see very clearly rings A and D. And this differs from the substance which I showed you earlier, which I called hesperamine, in that there is now an SR group rather than an OR group.

And now clearly, were we able to cleave this carbon bond, we should have at this point a thioester grouping rather than an ester grouping. In other words, a grouping which was clearly differentiable from the ester groupings at the other chain termini.

There was, of course, a serious question mark here in that having sulfur rather than oxygen gave us a potentially, at least, more versatile molecule. The ozonization might not have proceeded as smoothly or simply, because sulfur, unlike oxygen, is itself an oxidizable atom. And it might have been attacked, and the course of the reaction might not have been analogous to that observed with the oxygen analog at all.

# Ozonolysis of Thiohesperamines

Well, let's look at the next slide. Now our apprehensions, in fact, did turn out to some extent to be justified. This very elegant reaction in which the mercaptan went to one place and the methanol obediently went to another place was a very general one, and we were able to make analogs, what we call thiohesperamines, where the R group attached to sulfur was ethyl or methyl or tert-butyl or benzyl.

And we found that when these substances were ozonized, there was indeed cleavage of the carbon-carbon double bond, freeing an aldehyde group at one side and the desired thioester grouping at the other side. But in all of these cases, there was serious competition from an alternative reaction leading to an unusual product of this kind, an enolized β-keto sulfoxide.

Now, that's an unusual product, and it's an unusual reaction. We don't know its mechanism. It does not involve, by the way, prior attack on the sulfur, because we're able to make the sulfoxide corresponding to this thiohesperamine, and that is not attacked by ozone at all. So that the appearance of these secondary and undesired products is a matter of some alternative path of reaction in the product of the initial attack of ozone on the double bonded system.

Now the order of groupings that I've shown here, ethyl, methyl, butyl, benzyl is the order of diminishing amount of the unwanted by-product, the enolized hydroxy unsaturated sulfoxide. The benzyl case, the contamination by the unwanted product is rather small, but reasoning rather simply, we felt that if we made the sulfur less oxidizable, the result would be better still. And that turned out to be the case.

And as we see on the next slide, when we made the phenyl compound, the phenyl analog with phenyl group attached directly to sulfur, then there was essentially no secondary reaction. The ozonization proceeded very smoothly to give the aldehyde phenylthioester, as shown, this product in the middle.

Now, the thioester, and in particular the phenylthioester, is a very reactive ester grouping, far more so than the normal ester groupings at the other three chain termini. And consequently it was a very easy matter to transform that phenylthioester grouping into a simple amide grouping just by a few minutes' contact with liquid ammonia. And there is no attack upon the normal oxygen ester groupings in that reaction with ammonia.

# Practical Insights from AD Sequence

Now, I think I ought to mention parenthetically here a couple of other rather interesting points about this sequence. In the first place, you'll notice that the product, both in these cases of sulfur-containing compounds and in the initial model case of hesperamine, all of the products are α-aminoaldehydes. Now, I don't think there are, to my knowledge, there are no other α-aminoaldehydes known. And it needs only a moment's reflection to be convinced that that's not surprising at all. An exceptionally reactive set of groupings, an α-amino group directly adjacent to an aldehyde grouping. And yet here, these are perfectly stable substances.

Furthermore you will observe that we were using a pretty vigorous reagent to carry out these carbon-carbon bond cleavages namely ozone but there was no attack whatsoever upon the carbon-nitrogen double bond which survived intact both in the case of the thiohesperamines and in the case of hesperamine itself.

Now to what do we attribute this remarkable phenomenon? I think this is a dramatic or spectacular instance of the operation of simple steric hindrance. That carbon-nitrogen double bond, which is not attacked here, is so surrounded by other groupings, the space around it is simply so filled that not even a small molecule like ozone can get into it. In other words it protected in the simplest possible way in that access to it even by the smallest reagent is completely denied.

Now thereby hangs another moderately amusing tale. After these reactions had been carried out one of my collaborators wanted to try a similar series of changes in a simpler case, and he did so with absolutely catastrophic results. The mixture of products that was obtained was enough to make one ill. The plate chromatograms on these things showed endless series of spots of every color of the rainbow.

So, and had we chosen to investigate the feasibility of this kind of reaction through studying that model, we should have been discouraged, had we not been we, because I don't believe in models at all. I've seen this kind of thing happen dozens and dozens of times both ways. The model that works bombs out completely in the actual case, and here we have the even more dangerous situation where the actual case that works fails completely in the model. So don't trust too much in models either way.

Well, this did give us then, this sequence of reactions, a way of getting to the aldehydoamide, primary amide, shown here on the right. And now if we look on the next slide, we'll see how a few remaining simple steps were carried out in order to complete the preparation of an AD building block for vitamin B12 synthesis.

# Completion of AD Cyanobromide

The aldehyde group was reduced very simply by sodium borohydride to a corresponding primary alcohol grouping. Again there was no reduction of the carbon-nitrogen double bond and undoubtedly the very great utilization of the space around that carbon-nitrogen double bond by other atoms and groupings. In other words steric hindrance was responsible for the fact that carbon-nitrogen double bond reduction was not a complication.

Next, two steps were carried out in one operation. The hydroxyamide was converted to the mesylate nitrile by treatment with methanesulfonic anhydride. You see, that's a mesylation of the hydroxyl group, and at the same time, the primary amide group is dehydrated to nitrile.

Now, this is a simple experimental point which I think is worth making. That is, the use of methanesulfonic anhydride for this reaction avoided very serious complications, which occurred if methanesulfonyl chloride or methanesulfonyl bromide, which is less accessible, were used. In that when, let us say, methanesulfonyl chloride was used, part of the mesylate was converted to chloride. That is, this mesylate group was partly converted to chloride, and that caused a lot of trouble in detail.

I shan't bore you with the details, but there might be many of you who would face a problem of that kind, and a very easy way to circumvent it is to use this hitherto little-used reagent, methanesulfonic anhydride, which is a beautifully crystalline substance, well-behaved, and is free of that complication of halide ion displacement on the product.

Now, in fact, the next step, the last step in this sequence, is a halide ion displacement, but a controlled one carried out with lithium bromide in dimethylformamide, and that cleanly replaces the mesyl group by bromide.

And so, in this box we now have with this cyanobromide or bromonitrile we have an AD component representing rings A and D of the vitamin B12 molecule with the six asymmetric carbon atoms all properly placed relative to one another with the chains reminiscent of those that we shall need in the end and with this particular propionic acid chain differentiated in the form of a nitrile grouping from these other chains where there are carbomethoxyl groupings.

Now I remind you also that this substance is optically active. It is of the right absolute configuration as shown. I haven't showed you where that happened. That happened in the steps leading up to coronosterone, so we're not going to hear anything about it tonight.

But in this, the stereochemical problem presented in this building block, the stereochemical problem presented by the AD, six contiguous atom system, six contiguous chiral centers, is completely solved, with the centers placed correctly both in an absolute and a relative sense.

# BC Fragment: Thiodecal in

And now we were ready to effect the combination of this intermediate representing rings A and D with another intermediate representing rings B and C, and you'll see that on the next slide.

You see here again we have the cyanobromide, which we've just seen, and over on the right, thiodecalin, which contains rings B and C, and apposite groupings about these two rings. Here's a propionic chain, you see, another propionic chain, methyl groups where they should be, a methyl group where they should be, a potential acetic chain here.

Now, thiodecalin was prepared largely through the efforts of our collaborators in Zurich through a sequence of about 21 steps. Again, it's rather hard to decide how many steps were actually involved. And again, those steps have been described in the literature to which I alluded earlier and I'm not going to mention anything further about them tonight I think.

Now there also in this thiodecalin a sinister circle. Note that sinister circle. Now, that's one of the chiral centers of the vitamin B12 molecule.

Now, this BC intermediate was made by the combination of a ring B building block with a ring C building block. You see, there is a good deal of past history that I'm not able to tell you here tonight.

But in the combination of ring B with ring C, although the correct stereochemistry had been set up at this center in the ring B component for the condensation that led to thiodecalin, that stereochemistry was lost in the course of the joining of ring B to ring C. So that, in fact, when thiodecalin was obtained, although the opposite chiral centers had been correctly oriented in the intermediates used, thiodecalin itself was obtained as a mixture of diastereomers differing in configuration at this center.

Now that is because that center is a labile center. You see, it bears a hydrogen atom. It's adjacent to a conjugated system, and in thiodecalin itself and in all of the compounds which I shall be discussing subsequently, we were faced with the problem of lability, stereochemical lability at a center of this sort.

Now that lability is so serious that although, for example, it was possible to separate the diastereomeric thiodecalins into the two pure diastereomeric compounds, one of them having the correct configuration here and the other not having the correct configuration at that circled center, although those two pure substances could be separated, there was no use separating them because immediately in the very next series the stereochemistry is lost again.

And so in fact in practice we use the mixture of thiodecalins. It happens by the way to be a very beautifully crystalline mixture. You'd never know to look at it that it was a mixture of substances. They say beauty is no test of purity.

# Sulfur-Bridged Coupling of AD and BC

All right, now, the cyanobromide, largely prepared here in Cambridge, the thiodecalin, largely prepared in Zurich, were first combined using potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran, and you can see what happens.

This is a thiolactam grouping. The ionization of the hydrogen gives an anion, the sulfur of which is highly nucleophilic. It displaces the bromine of this cyanobromide and there is formed the obvious product, thioether type 1, in which the two groups, the AD portion of the molecule and the BC portion are now joined together.

Now here I should again parenthetically make an important point. We tried very, very, very many methods of effecting the direct union of the various BC intermediates with various AD intermediates. By direct, I mean processes resulting in the formation directly of a carbon-carbon bond between this carbon atom and this one. That's what we want. And all of those direct methods failed miserably.

This was again a case in which model substances were misleading, it was possible to join together in many cases to give carbon-carbon bonds, substances vaguely resembling this with, let's say, an electrophilic center here and a nucleophilic center there. All of these processes failed in the actual cases which we needed to bring about in order to effect the union of these AD and BC halves corresponding actually to what we hoped would one day be vitamin B12.

So you see here the concept was to get those two atoms, this one as it happens and this one, close together, join them by the sulfur atom, a bridging sulfur atom, so that the carbon-carbon bond formation that we needed would be an intramolecular process and one therefore which would presumably be much favored over any bimolecular analog.

And on the next slide you'll see more or less what we had in mind in a little more detail.

[Slide: Mechanism sketch]

I wonder, Olien, if you could focus it a bit better. Well, good. Now you see, pay attention mainly to the colored parts of the slide where you have this C=N double bond. There's the CH₂ group, the sulfur, and the carbon-nitrogen double bond of this thioiminoether system.

Now, you see, if a hydrogen could be taken from here as a proton, then one might make the desired carbon-carbon bond. There's the bond that's wanted, where that green arrow is. And since the two halves are held together by sulfur, as I say, the formation of that bond would be an intramolecular process and therefore perhaps favored.

And then, if one could remove the sulfur, lo and behold, one would have the bond that one needed, the needed carbon-carbon bond.

Now, these are just explicative slides, and so you will recognize that these don't refer to compounds in the actual series, because you'll notice there's still a carbomethoxyl group down here, not a nitrile group. This will remind you of the fact that we had to surmount a differentiation problem on the one hand, but we also had the advantage that we could use these rather simpler compounds with the carbomethoxyl group here as models which in this case were useful.

Now this then was what we hoped to be able to accomplish. We hoped to be able to transform these compounds, these thioethers which we call thioethers of type 1 into carbon-carbon linked ADCB compounds.

# Thioether Type 1 to Type 2 Isomerization

However that was not an easy thing to do, and in particular it was not easy to do in a practical way. And if we may have a glance at the next slide, we'll see really what caused a great deal of trouble.

The thioethers of type 1 are extraordinarily unstable substances. They can be prepared, by the way, in the manner that I indicated, in virtually quantitative yield, provided one works with the extreme care and skill to which my collaborators become accustomed. But although prepared in nearly quantitative yield, they are diabolically sensitive substances. They undergo many changes.

But the most outstanding change which they undergo is shown here. Again, pay attention to the colored part of the slide. You can see that if there were a proton about, it could protonate this nitrogen. And then proton could be lost from this nitrogen. And the result of that would be the transformation of the original structure into an isomeric structure, which is labeled here, thioether type 2.

And you see, it now has a double bond in ring C, within ring C. Now, also, if you inspect this for a moment and think about it, you'll realize that the thioether of type 2 is much more stable than the thioether of type 1 observe that you have built into it a vinylogous amidine system. That's quite a stable system.

You can see that if this were protonated for example it would be expected to protonate on this nitrogen to give a charge-resonant salt, which would be a very stable salt. Whereas if you look at the precursor, the thioether type 1, you see you don't have any stabilization possibilities of that sort whatsoever.

And so the fact is that most of the efforts to transform the thioether type 1 into the desired carbon-carbon linked ADCB system were frustrated by this extremely ready change of the thioether type 1 into the stable thioether type 2.

Now, after many attempts to bring that situation under control, we decided that we could not bring it under control. And so, as we see on the next slide, we simply took advantage of the fact that the thioether type 1 was readily transformed into the thioether type 2. and effected that change, which can be effected quantitatively with a small amount of trifluoroacetic acid in an inert solvent.

Now, it sounds all right, except that I showed you that the thioether type 1 was all set up for the carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction, and the thioether type 2 is not. There is no simple sequence of reactions which will enable one to produce a bond, a carbon-carbon bond from here to here, starting with the thioether type 2.

And experiments seem to bear out the fact that thioether type 2 didn't look very much like a good candidate for bringing about the desired union of the two halves.

Clearly, what we had to do, essentially, was set up some kind of situation in which there would be some of the thioether type 1 in equilibrium with the thioether type 2. And the difficulty with that as I already pointed out is that the thioether type 2 system has a vinylogous amidine system. The protonation takes place there, and therefore protonation here and deprotonation there may be expected to be a very difficult process.

Well, the search for the means of bringing that about took an unbelievably long time and a great deal of work in both Zurich and Cambridge. But it was ultimately solved, and it was found that the thioether type 2 could, in fact, be transformed in very high yield into the desired compound containing a carbon-carbon link.

# Desulfurization to Cyanocorrigenolide

As we see on the next slide, there is a carbon-carbon link. The sulfur is gone. And this was carried out using trifluoroacetic acid and tris(β-cyanoethyl)phosphine. that takes up the sulfur. I won't say at what stage it takes up the sulfur, but it does take up the sulfur. And the function of the trifluoroacetic acid, of course, is to effect protonation.

What was crucial here was the choice of solvent. And where many, many solvents had failed, the first solvent which did work was sulfolane, and then ultimately at a later time it was found that the reaction could be carried out in nitromethane.

And when the right conditions had been found, this thioether type 2 could be transformed into this substance with this trivial name, cyanocorrigenolide, in which now the ADCB system is all built up. The four rings are together, and we've affected a union of the two halves through the desired carbon-carbon bond at this point.

Notice that we started, of course, here with a substance which was a mixture in that the stereochemical integrity had been lost at this point. And clearly going through such an intermediate as this it will have been lost here. So now we got two of those sinister circles you see. And actually this product cyanocorrigenolide is a mixture undoubtedly of all of the possible diastereomeric compounds once.

Now you can see that we have the linear system. It doesn't look very linear here, but that's what it is, ADCB system. And clearly what we've got to do now is effect the closure of the macrocyclic ring system.

# Preparation for A-B Cyclization

And we found that a crucial change before bringing about this much needed cyclization, as you will see on the next slide, is the conversion of this oxygen compound. You see its cyanocorrigenolide is a lactone, lactam.

And with phosphorus pentasulfide in xylene, containing a small amount of γ-picoline, the oxygen compound is transformed into a dithio analog in which the lactam carbonyl group is transformed into a thiolactam system, while at the same time the lactone system is transformed into a thiolactone system.

Now this dithio compound was a far more reactive compound than the oxygen analog, And as we see on the next slide, the most useful of its reactions was that with dimethylamine. Dimethylamine attacks this thiolactone grouping quite cleanly, generating a dimethylamide and liberating an exocyclic carbon-carbon double bond.

Now, we don't know precisely how that reaction occurs. I've written it as involving a direct attack of the dimethylamine on the carbonyl group of the thiolactone. That may or may not represent the real state of affairs, I may say that both that thiolactone and the lactone from which it had been prepared are very stable rings to most conditions.

For example, in the case of the lactone, a very, very large excess of base is needed to bring about the opening of the lactone ring. such a large excess of base that the reaction products are of no use for further synthetic purposes because the desired material is buried in such a huge excess of lye that you can't do anything with it.

But the dimethylamine reaction is a very clean one. It may take place, as shown by direct attack of the dimethylamine on the carbonyl group. But it may be that there's an elimination reaction involving this hydrogen and the thiolactone to give a thioacid grouping. It is at least an interesting fact that unlike acids, thioacids react spontaneously with amines to give amides. And I rather suspect that in this case it is that latter thing which is involved and which so sharply differentiates this thiol case from the oxygen case.

Now, a second very important feature of this change brought about by dimethylamine is the appearance of this exocyclic carbon-carbon double bond. Now that's needed because we want this carbon atom, which you can see is nucleophilic. Essentially, it's an electron source.

Under many conditions it is found that when that thiolactone ring or the lactone ring in the earlier case, is opened, the products obtained do not contain the double bond system shown here with the exocyclic methylene group, but rather an endocyclic arrangement of double bonds, an endocyclic arrangement of double bonds with both of the double bonds within ring C, and with a methyl group out where the exocyclic methylene group is here. And those are useless for further synthetic purposes. Furthermore, they are the stable. That represents the stable arrangement of double bonds with the endocyclic system.

And so this dimethylamine reaction is very important in that it generates the exocyclic system under very gentle conditions and one gets no conversion to this useless endocyclic isomeric system.

# Zinc-Mediated Oxidative Cyclization (A-B Closure)

Well, now we're getting set up for making that bond across the top of the system to complete the macrocyclic ring. and on the next slide we'll see that after introduction of zinc into this product of the dimethylamine opening of the thiolactone, you see here it is again with the dimethylamide, the exocyclic methylene group, zinc is introduced into this in some unknown form. We haven't a clue as to precisely what kind of zinc complex this is, but we do know there's zinc in it.

And we surmise that the zinc plays a role in the next reaction, which consists, it's an oxidative reaction using iodine in methanol, or really potassium triiodide in methanol at room temperature, which results in the formation of a sulfur-bridged compound of this structure, again retaining the zinc in a form which has not been precisely defined.

Now, you see, the zinc presumably helps in making this cyclization the formation of a relatively small ring. That is I drawn of course these tetracyclic linear intermediates as though the A and the B rings were close to one another but they're not necessarily close to one another in the actual molecules. But if one puts a zinc in the middle of it, that brings them close together and facilitates this oxidative coupling of this sulfur to carbon.

Now, again, the details of this oxidation with potassium triiodide and methanol are not known. It is entirely likely that the iodide, triiodide or iodine really, attacks this nucleophilic center and gives an iodocompound and that then the thiolactam grouping displaces the iodine.

And if that be the case, and it seems quite likely that it is, you will notice that the formation now of this link between rings A and B is beginning to bear very close similarities to the processes that we used to bring about the union of ring D and C, where again we had a thioether bridge.

Now, in any event, this cyclic sulfur compound can be transformed further. First, the zinc is removed. The zinc comes out very easily with acid. And on the next slide, we see what happens when the resulting product deprived of zinc is treated in this case with trifluoroacetic acid and triphenylphosphine at 85 degrees.

Again, this is the same reaction which you saw earlier on one of the earlier slides. the formation through a sulfur-bridged compound of a carbon-carbon bond. Carbon-carbon bond here. And then there's triphenylphosphine in this case to take up the sulfur.

And after the bond is formed and the sulfur has been removed, zinc is put back in, in this case simply to facilitate isolation. And here at this stage we now have, for the first time, completed the 16 macrocyclic system. There it is in all its glory isolated initially as the zinc chloride complex.

That is a fairly complicated sequence of reactions to effect that union of rings A and B. But in fact, again, with the skillful collaborators of the type that Professor Eschenmoser and I have. That fairly complicated sequence of reactions can be carried out in something like 60% overall yield for something like eight steps. So that's really a very good sequence, provided one uses great skill and care.

# Cobalt Insertion

Now, the next step would appear to be a fairly easy one. Let's look at the next slide. There is the zinc complex, which you saw before, and the zinc is simply removed. Zinc comes out of these complexes with acid very easily and replaced by cobalt.

We had, at the outset of our work, rather felt that the introduction of cobalt into these corrinoid substances should represent no problem whatsoever. That turned out to be very, very far from the case. It was indeed, in many cases, extremely difficult to introduce cobalt into these substances.

In Zurich, many of their initial attempts, some of them successful, to introduce cobalt into chlorins and chlorinoid precursors involved the use of cobalt perchlorate in acetonitrile. I think because Professor Schwarzenbach, the inorganic professor at the ETH, believed in this reagent as the best of all reagents for introducing cobalt into things. Well, it's about the worst, probably because there are six acetonitriles coordinated fairly strongly to the cobalt, and the cobalt isn't accessible to anything.

Our experience, to make a very, very long story short, ended in the discovery that if we used cobalt chloride and anhydrous cobalt chloride in tetrahydrofuran, we got spectacularly successful cobaltations in cases where all other things had been to no avail. and thereby hangs a rather interesting story.

If one looks into the inorganic literature, that marvelous array of mysterious things, one finds frequently that in making cobalt complexes that in order to facilitate the process one hurls in a teaspoon full of charcoal. Well, that seemed pretty much like an old wives tale, but I think I know what's involved there, or we know what's involved there as a result of our experiences in this B12 work.

Charcoal, at least in the old days, and probably still, it always contained hydrochloric acid, and quite a bit of it. And I think the function of the charcoal was to convert some portion of whatever cobalt was being used into the cobalt halide, which is actually the reactive species in the cobaltation.

Now Eschenmoser and I'll try anything and after we had found here that the cobalt chloride could be used thank you by the way could be used he set up an experiment with the cobalt chloride on a particular substance and found that the cobalt was indeed as we had reported smoothly introduced.

And then he said, well, I really don't believe that the chloride is specific. And he set up or had set up for him a similar experiment precisely similar experiment except he used cobalt perchlorate. And he got no cobaltation whatsoever. And then he put in the teaspoonful of charcoal and lo and behold he got cobaltation.

All right anyway once the mystery was solved it was an easy matter to replace the zinc in this initial corrin by cobalt, generally isolated with the two cyanide ligands. And at that point, you see we were fairly well along. We had a bis-norcobyrinic acid. We can even give it a name now up in the getting up into things related to the natural series. ABDEG pentamethyl ester.

There they are. This is A, B, C, D, E, F, G. And you see there are five ester groups, one dimethylamide group and one nitrile group down here. And the macrocyclic ring has now been closed. The whole ABCD system, we can now call it, is together, and we have some attractive-looking, potentially favorable substituents about this ring system.

But note now a third sinister circle up here. That is, there was no reason to suppose that just as we had lability at this position, which we can now number position 8 of the corrin nucleus, and in the intermediates leading to this, and at this 13 position, likewise, we should expect some lability at position 3.

And so we could suppose that at this stage, we actually had a very complicated mixture of diastereomesomeric substances, differing in configuration variously at these three centers.

# Stereoisomer Complexity at C3, C8, C13

Now, in fact, the substance, the mixture of substances, obtained by this route, what we call oxidative cyclization. And I might mention parenthetically that we had another method of cyclization up at the top between rings A and B, a different method which I'm not going to say anything about tonight.

The product from this cyclization was in fact chromatographically homogeneous. That is on a plate chromatogram a single spot or a single line, if one was using a lot of material, appeared and it looked entirely homogeneous, as though it were one material. And yet it was very unreasonable to suppose that it was one material. It was very likely a mixture of several isomers.

In fact, it turns out that all eight possible isomers are present. And from now on, we're much concerned then with this problem of stereochemistry, this rather special problem of stereochemistry, introduced into our work by the lability of centers 3, 8, and 13.

And we should certainly, I think, not have been able to make further progress with this problem, or at the very least it would have been fantastically more difficult, were it not for the present availability of high-pressure chromatographic methods.

# HPLC Resolution of Diastereomers

And now on the next slide, you will see how high-pressure chromatographic methods contributed to the solution of these specially formidable stereochemical problems.

Now, high-pressure chromatographic methods were used both in Zurich and here in Cambridge.

[Slide: Chromatograms; focus adjustment]

Thank you. I think that is a bit better. Now, you see, there are three centers, 3, 8, 13. the groups at those centers might be either up, that's β, or down, that's α. α, by the way, is the natural configuration. In vitamin B12 itself, the chains at those respective places are below the plane of the formula in the α configuration at all three at position 3 at position 8 and position 13.

Now, as I say, both in Zurich and in Cambridge, we used high-pressure chromatographic methods. In Zurich, they used essentially partition chromatographic methods, that is, liquid chromatography in which a stationary phase on Kieselguhr was passed over by a mobile phase. Whereas in Cambridge we used so-called adsorption liquid chromatography. That is, we had a solvent system passing over a solid support on which the material being chromatographed was adsorbed and desorbed, of course.

Now, the methods complement one another often very beautifully, and I think that's shown, or I hope it's shown fairly clearly in this slide.

At the top, at the top, you see the separation of the total mixture of such a cyclization in the Zurich column. I won't give you the details. I can if you wish, but in any event, the material, the total mixture of these cyanodimethylamides, separates into five clearly defined fractions, as shown there.

Now the three white fractions are, in fact, pure substances. They are the ααβ, the ββα, and the βββ compounds. You see, here's the βββ compound. That's the one with all of the three chains in unnatural configuration. But these three are pure substances in the Zurich, separable easily in the Zurich system.

Now the material in the Cambridge system looks like this. Here again, the total material in the liquid chromatographic system, which we use here in Cambridge, looks like this. And you see that's a fairly complicated chromatogram. But it would be possible, actually, to separate probably all of the substances in that system, though it would be a very difficult separation indeed.

However, suppose we combine the two, and that's what we did, of course. First, we send the material to Zurich, and they separate it into these five fractions. These three, the ones represented by these white peaks, are already pure.

Now, the red peak is a mixture of two substances, which appear here and here in our chromatogram, and so you see are very easily separable in the Cambridge system.

Now, likewise, the band shown in blue in the Zurich system is a mixture of three components, not separated on their column, but appearing at widely different positions in our system.

So after the material is separated in the high pressure partition chromatographic system in Zurich, sent back here to Cambridge, and put through our chromatographic system, which leads to a fairly ready separation. And as I say, all eight substances have been separated, characterized, and structurally identified.

And here they are. Here's the summary of the results. Now the ααα, 3α, 8α, 13α, is the natural configuration. And then here are the others. You see there's 36% of that in this mixture, 31% of the compound with C13 inverted to the unnatural configuration. And then variously 6.6, 5.3, 9.6, 7.9, 1.9, and 1.7, finally, percentages of these various other isomers.

Notice that the all unnatural one, the 3β, 8β, 13β has only 1.7 percent very little material. But it is there.

Now two things are worthy of comment about this mixture and the composition of this mixture. One to which I call particular attention is that the compounds having three-α configurations, that is with the propionic chain at position three in the natural or α configuration comprise almost 80% of the material. And that's very important, as you'll see in a moment. And there's only about 20% which is made up of these four components having the unnatural 3β configuration. Most of the material, in other words, is 3α with the propionic chain at C3 attached to ring A, oriented in the natural configuration.

Now, one comment about the composition of this mixture, as shown and determined here. We can't really say just what determines this composition. We don't think that these really are the equilibrium compositions among these isomers. Probably the result is a combination of a tendency toward equilibrium plus the configurations already established in the precursors. And I don't think I'll say anything more than that about it.

# Oxidation to Lactone and Further Resolution

Now, let us go on to the next slide. And here we see the cyanodimethylamide. Note the three open circles, so this just refers for the moment to all of them, all eight of them, since I'm not defining configuration.

Now, you recall that we had a good deal of trouble, in fact, a good deal more than I have emphasized here tonight, in getting our lactone ring opened in our ADCB intermediate. And I mentioned that a very simple and elegant solution to that problem was achieved by the opening of the thiolactone grouping by dimethylamine.

Well that turns out not only to have been very useful at that stage but now this dimethylamide is smoothly converted by oxidation with iodine and acetic acid to a lactone of the structure shown here on the right. and you see what is involved. This position 8 is oxidized and with participation of this dimethylamide grouping a new carbon oxygen bond is formed to give this lactone.

Now, the oxidizability of vitamin B12 and substances allied to it at that position 8 is well known. But it's rather capricious, and in particular, for example, if this group be an ester group rather than a dimethylamide group, the oxidation is extremely inefficient. It barely takes place at all, or only in very low yield and with great difficulty.

Making place at an earlier stage was very useful in that it permitted the very ready production of this new system, this lactone system.

Now, why did we want that lactone system? A minor reason. You notice that we have now fixed the stereochemistry at C8. Because when we produce this lactone, we now have a fused system of two five-membered rings, and of course that can be produced only when this bond and this bond are cis, when this is a cis-fused system.

So both the 8-α and the 8-β-oriented substances are converted to the same lactone, And that's been established, by the way. We've taken experimentally the particular pure cyanodimethylamide and oxidized it and found that from the 8-β and the 8-α compound, one gets the same lactone. So the stereochemical problem is to some extent simplified in the course of this step.

Now again, although the stereochemical problem has been simplified, it is complicated still. But again, using high-pressure chromatographic methods, the desirable or necessary separations, as the case may be, can be relatively easily effected.

And on the next slide, we see another example of that.

[Slide: More chromatograms; focus]

Aha. Good. Now, here I've chosen to show the traces, the chromatographic traces in a slightly different way. But again, I've shown how the combination of the Zurich methods and the Cambridge methods are extremely useful.

The partition chromatographic columns in Zurich, LLC, separate the oxidation product derived from a mixture of all eight cyanodimethylamides into two fractions, very cleanly into two fractions. One of these fractions is α at 3 and β at 13. The other is α at 3 and α at 13. You notice that they now both have the same configuration at C8. So that these are the compounds which have the natural configuration at C3. These, in this band shown here in blue, have the unnatural configuration at C3.

Now, again, the fractions from the Zurich partition chromatographic columns can be put on the Cambridge adsorption liquid chromatographic columns, and here are traces obtained. From the red band, for example, there's a very easy separation into the two pure components, the 3α, 13β, and the 3α, 13α. Actually I've shown here two cycles, and you see already in the second cycle the separation is virtually perfect.

Likewise, the mixture of β compounds on our Cambridge columns is very readily separated into the two components, the ββ and the βα.

And again, on the right here, a summary of the composition of the mixture of lactones obtained when the total mixture of cyanodimethylamides is subjected to oxidation with iodine in acetic acid. And you'll see there's very good agreement. These are independent figures. 78% of 3α compounds, and you remember it was 78.6 before, and 22, and it was 21 point something before. Again, you see a heavy preponderance of 3α compounds.

All of these lactones have been separated, characterized, and identified structurally. And it is worthwhile to emphasize here just how extremely powerful these high pressure chromatographic columns are. You'll notice that they are effecting separations of substances which are extremely closely related. Very large molecules, molecular weight over 1,000, differing in configuration only at one center, separated very easily.

Now, let us go on to the, oh, I should just say parenthetically that the number of plates involved in these separations can be enormous. It can go up to as much as 9,000 theoretical plates. Most of the separations shown here are lower than that. 6,000 is fairly common. Ours get down more nearly to the 2,000 level. But you can see that it is a very, very powerful method, indeed. Properly used, it can exceed in sensitivity and selectivity gas chromatography or gas liquid chromatography.


# Chromatographic Separation Power

Most of the separations shown here are lower than that. 6,000 is fairly common. Ours get down more nearly to the 2,000 level. But you can see that it is a very, very powerful method indeed. Properly used, it can exceed the sensitivity and selectivity of gas chromatography, or gas liquid chromatography.

# Lactone Strategy for Protecting C10 and Enabling C5/C15 Methylation

Now let us go on to the next slide. And here we have now on the left the lactone structure, and we'll see just why it was very important that we produce that lactone grouping. Not only did we simplify the stereochemical problem by making that lactone, but we created favorable circumstances in connection with our next major problem, which was the introduction of two groupings as yet missing from these synthetic molecules. Namely, it was necessary to introduce methyl groups into positions 5 and 15. We needed somehow to effect substitution reactions at those points. At the same time, we must not introduce anything into position 10. How to avoid that?

Well, the formation of this lactone was the way to avoid that. Because in producing that new carbon-oxygen bond and making the lactone ring, we have now flanked C10 by two completely substituted carbon atoms. That at C8 has four substituents. That at C12 has four substituents. So C10 is a terribly hindered position.

Now to be sure C5 is not all that unhindered. It got a couple of large groups here opposite 5 and a couple of large groups here near 15. But on the other side there is at least a hydrogen atom you see. That kind of a relief of tension, shall we say. And over here at position 3, next to 5, there is a hydrogen atom. And so we can say that position 10 in these lactones is very, very hindered, and we felt that there was a good chance that we could effect substitution reactions at positions 5 and 15 without any complication from substitution at C10.

# Electrophilic Hydroxymethylation and Phenylthiomethyl Intermediates

Now, that hope, plan if you wish, was crowned with success. In fact, we were able to find electrophilic substitution reactions on the lactones without, in which, that is, no substitution occurred at C10, while substitution did occur at C5 and at C15.

The question may come up in many of your minds, what about the intrinsic reactivity of the three positions? That is, is there any reason to suppose that C5 or C15, or both of them, since they're symmetrical electronically, might be substituted more readily than C10. Well, there are some calculations which suggest, to the extent that you think calculations of that sort do suggest anything, a mild preference for substitution at C5 and C15 as compared with C10. But actual electrophilic substitution reactions on simple model corrins gave a rather confused picture. That is, if there was any preference for substitution at C5 and C15, it was a very small one indeed in practice. So we didn't dare take a chance on that. And we built in this lactone system just to block this simply sterically so that no substitution could take place here.

And now this is the overall result of the process used or the first stage in the introduction of the required methyl groups into positions 5 and 15. Now the first stage consists of an oxymethylation reaction using formaldehyde sulfolane hydrogen chloride reagent in acetonitrile as solvent. And under these conditions, there is presumably introduced into positions 5 and 15 hydroxymethyl groups. The hydroxymethyl groups may well, under these reaction conditions, not survive, but rather be transformed into chloromethyl groups. There is hydrogen chloride there. And we chose the device of adding, after the initial hydroxymethylation reaction, treatment with thiophenol in benzene in order to transform the hydroxyl or chloromethyl groupings into phenylthiomethyl groupings.

Now, that choice was made for a number of reasons. One, we felt that these intermediates would be more stable substances, and they are. And also, we were adding a great deal of bulk in the form of the S-phenyl groupings. And so we felt that chromatographic separations, and at that time we were thinking of plate chromatographic separations, should be possible, which would easily permit us to separate mono from di and from possibly tri substitution products, because the bulk of the compounds would be considerably different. Because the bis(phenylthiomethyl) compound has two phenyl groups, a similar monocompound with hydrogen still here would have only one of these large groups, and its chromatographic behavior might well be expected to be quite different. That is the mono and the di substituted material.

Now that in fact turned out to be the case though as time went on, of course, the plate chromatographic methods were superseded by the high-pressure chromatographic methods, which were far more powerful.

# Evolution of Hydroxymethylation from Chloromethylation

Now this is also the point at which I might make some allusion to the hilarious events of a year ago last summer, which I described in Boston, much to my entertainment, and I think, that of the audience. This hydroxymethylation reaction had been preceded by a chloromethylation reaction, initially carried out using chloromethyl benzyl ether, which worked. It didn't work very well, but it did work. And then a considerable amount of effort here and in Zurich led to the vast improvement of the method through the substitution of chloromethyl methyl ether, vast improvement in terms of yield of substituted product. But the substitution in that case was accompanied by complete conversion of the cyano group into carbomethoxy group. And that represented at the time something of a disaster.

However, the new procedure of hydroxymethylation using the, actually it's trioxane, sulfolane, hydrogen chloride reagent in acetonitrile as solvent, gives no, violates in no way this nitrile group. It remains as a nitrile group. And the yield is high.

# Configurational Purification During Substitution

Now, furthermore, you'll notice one thing here which is of much interest. I've written here the lactone, cyano-lactone, with the configuration at 3 with one of these sinister circles. That is, it's still alpha and beta. It's a mixture, differing in configuration at that point. And I've written the product as having only the 3-alpha, the natural configuration. That is, the 5,15-bis(phenylthiomethyl) cyano-lactone which is obtained, or cyano-lactones, notice there's still a circle here, have only the natural configuration at C3.

That's really a very interesting point. So one gets a chemical purification here as one goes along if one hasn't separated.

Now, actually, this mixture, by the way, can be separated very easily. It's now just a mixture of two compounds differing in configuration at C13. And perhaps this is the point to say that the compounds differing in configuration at C13, down here in ring C, are well known from previous work on vitamin B12 and its congeners. The substances having the propionic chain down, or alpha, are the natural substances. Those having the propionic chain up, or beta, are the neo-compounds, which are well known from studies of others on vitamin B12.

# Chromatographic Separation of 13α/13β Isomers

Now this mixture of bis-alkylation products is simply a mixture of the normal and neo-compounds, the compounds differing in configuration at C13. And on the next slide, you'll see that the chromatographic separation, high pressure chromatographic separation of these two isomers is very easy indeed. Already on the first cycle, one sees an asymmetry to this band, which suggests a separation. The second cycle, they're coming apart, and the third more so. And here the normal or 13α and there the neo or 13β isomer. And note there are only two substances, only two substances.

# Regioselectivity and Stereoselectivity in Substitution

Now, in fact, this substitution situation is quite a complicated one. And I've tried to summarize it as simply as I could on the next slide.

Here are the 3β compounds. 3β, unnatural configuration at 3, 13α and/or β. That is, we can use a mixture of compounds, or we can separate them and treat them separately. But what we find is that the 3β compounds, that is, those having the unnatural configuration at C3 in the alkylation reaction are not substituted at C5 at all, but only at C15. They give the 3β, then 13α plus β, 15-mono(phenylthiomethyl) derivatives, only monosubstituted, no substitution up here. These are what we called loosely, as household term, blue mono. They have an exceptionally long wavelength absorption for reasons which are not at all clear.

And when such monos, such 15-monosubstituted compounds, are subjected to further action of the electrophilic substitution reagent, there is no further substitution. That is, C5 cannot be substituted when the propionic chain at C3 is in the β configuration. Now, this further indicates that 3β is not isomerized or epimerized or equilibrated under the conditions of the reaction.

The situation is quite different, however, at C13.

# Substitution Pathways in the Natural 3α Series

Now let us look at the compounds of the 3α configuration, the natural series. It is possible to isolate a mono-compound, so red mono-compound which is the 5-compound. So you see when this chain is on the opposite side from this one, then 5-substitution takes place. But then that goes on, and in fact, if this be isolated, that is further alkylated to give the bis compound.

Now, presumably, there is lurking about in there somewhere, but we haven't observed it, also a 15-mono-compound, which is further alkylated to give the bis alkyl product.

Now, in this case, if one starts with a pure compound having either the α or the β configuration at C13, one gets the same mixture of normal and neo-bis substitution products. That is to say, then, under the conditions of the reaction, equilibration takes place readily at C13, but not at C3.

And this leads to a very interesting presumption. I don't think we can say that it's really established, but it appears that in these molecules, electrophilic substitution at C5 and C15 must take place from the top of the molecule. And that if we put a blocking group up on the top of the molecule at C3, that blocks substitution at C5. Undoubtedly, or rather, let's say, we think there's a strong reason to believe, the same is the case that if the β configuration obtains for the propionic chain at C13, there is no substitution, but this position is readily equilibrated under the conditions of the reaction so that it goes over to the α and is alkylated.

In any event, you can see then why, or at least you can see the relationships, I think. Namely, the substitution product that is desired, the bis substitution product, the 5,15-bis substitution product, comes only from the 3α substituted compounds. And you remember there 80% of the initial mixture. So the situation really pretty good, not bad at all.

# Reductive Desulfurization to Angular Methyls and Stereoresetting

Now, on the next slide, you can see the next stage. Here is the 5,15-bis(phenylthiomethyl) substituted compound, two of them. They both have, of course, as I've mentioned, the 3α configuration, the natural configuration at C3. Both configurations are available at C13, the normal, α, the neo, β. They can be separated, as I've already shown, but it's not really necessary to do so.

The changes which are now carried out consist in reduction with zinc and acetic acid, followed by treatment with diazomethane. And the following things happen. The zinc in acetic acid removes the phenylthio groups. It leaves these carbon-sulfur bonds here and here to give the desired methyl groups at 5 and 15. Concomitantly, the bond at C8 to oxygen is broken reductively to set up the desired hydrogen in the right configuration, in this case, stereospecifically, generating initially a carboxyl group which is esterified in the diazomethane step, in the second step.

And so in this way, one obtains a mixture of cobyrinic acid ABCDEG hexamethyl esters, F-nitrile, being the normal and the neo-compounds at C13. So we have now introduced the two desired methyl groups, and in the course of these operations, we've re-established our stereochemistry at C3 and C8.

We are also able to separate the isomers at C13. We could do that earlier, as I mentioned, in the case of the bis(phenylthiomethyl) compounds, or we can do it now, as you see on the next slide, on the nitriles themselves. In the liquid chromatographic system, and you can see some of the details here if you're interested in that kind of thing. The neo and the normal synthetic F-nitriles are very readily separated. That's almost an ideal high-pressure chromatogram.

# Summary of Achieved Corrin Periphery

Now on the next slide, then, we see a summary, essentially, of the position we have reached. Here are the cobyrinic acid ABCDEG hexamethyl ester F-nitriles, the normal compound having the propionic acid chain down at 13, and the neo-compound having the propionic acid chain up at C13. Both beautifully crystalline substances. And pure now, the stereochemical situation is resolved: all of the asymmetric centers at all nine positions around the periphery are in the right places.

# Intersection with Natural Series: B12 Degradation to Heptamethyl Cobyrinate

Now it was at this point that we intersected with substances known from the natural series. And beginning with the next slide, I can show you how that came about.

Vitamin B12 subjected to vigorous methanolysis, boiling methanol containing about 30% sulfuric acid for five days, gives this heptamethyl ester. You see all of the seven primary carboxy groups are converted into ester groups and that whole isopropanolamine phosphate, ribose, dimethylbenzimidazole grouping is removed and one gets this heptamethyl cobyrinate, cobester.

Now, when this cobester, this heptamethyl ester, is treated with ammonia in methanol under very mild conditions, a very interesting thing happens. You will observe, let's look at our heptamethyl cobyrinate first, that there are four propionic chains. Those are the ones shown in red. There are three acetic chains. Those are the ones shown in blue.

Now, the acetic chains are highly hindered chains. That is the carbonyl groups of the carbomethoxy groups in which those chains terminate, the acetic chains, are very hindered. Whereas those of the propionic chains are considerably further removed from the crowded center of this beast, and so they're relatively unhindered. And mirabile dictu, the molecule behaves as though that's just the way it is, because the treatment of the heptamethyl ester with ammonia under mild conditions, just a few hours at 60 degrees, gives a considerable mixture, unchanged heptamethyl ester, of course, some fairly highly aminated material, but largely a mixture of what you might call the expected four monoamides, namely those in which the propionic, the relatively unhindered propionic chains, have been converted from ester into amide.

So, in fact, there is produced as the major product from this mild aminolysis of heptamethyl cobyrinate this B, D, E, and F. And it will come as no surprise to you to learn that these are very readily separable by high pressure chromatographic methods. Now, as it happens, a preliminary separation in this case can even be carried out by plate chromatography. The B-amide is fairly readily separated, even on a plate. And then the remaining three, the D, E, and F-amides, can be separated by high-pressure chromatographic methods quite readily.

# Preparation of Natural F-Nitrile and Neo-F-Nitrile

Now, may we go on to the next slide? Where I show you on the left the F-amide, you see with this group now transformed into amide, obtained from heptamethyl cobyrinate, and that in turn from vitamin B12 by fairly easy processes.

Now, that normal F-amide obtained in that way can be transformed into an equilibrium mixture with a neo-cobyrinic acid ABCDEG hexamethyl ester F-amide, the neo-F-amide, which differs from the substance only in configuration at C13. That equilibration is brought about by concentrated sulfuric acid. Fairly vicious reagent, but it doesn't destroy these things. And it does effect a clean equilibration at C13.

So in this way, one can obtain the normal F-amide and the neo-F-amide. Notice the unusual thing, and from the synthetic point of view, somewhat dastardly thing that the neo series, the unnatural series, is in this case heavily favored at equilibrium. But in any event the compounds both normal and neo are available this way and from the amides by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride and pyridine the corresponding nitriles can be obtained. Just a dehydration of the amide to nitrile.

# Confirmation of Synthetic Identity via Equilibration

So, on the next slide, we see how we were first able to establish a connection between the synthetic series and the natural series. If you take the F-nitrile and treat with concentrated sulfuric acid, you convert the nitrile group into amide. Of course, at the same time, you equilibrate. So when you take the nitrile, you get a mixture, this equilibrium mixture of the normal and neo-amides.

Now, using high pressure chromatographic methods, it was easily possible to show that of the four amides prepared from vitamin B12. Only one had the same chromatographic retention time as the amide prepared from the synthetic nitrile, and the same was true of the neo-compound, the corresponding neo-compound. So this established which one of that mixture of amides obtained from vitamin B12 through heptamethyl cobyrinate was the F-monoamide, and correspondingly from it, the F-nitrile.

# Derivation of Authentic F-Nitriles from B12

So now again, on the next slide, you see the same two compounds, the cobyrinic acid hexamethyl ester F-nitrile, and the corresponding neo-F-nitrile, the two compounds with the normal and the unnatural configuration at C13, in this case derived from vitamin B12. So now we have compounds which were made by the synthetic route, and we have compounds which were derived by a very easy degradation of vitamin B12 itself, and they should be the same.

# Crystal Comparisons

Now let's compare them. Now to start with, I mentioned already once in the case of the synthetic compounds that both the normal and the neo-F nitriles were beautifully crystalline substances. Now, I love crystals. One of my daughters is named Crystal, and I think she got that name because I was asked about the time she was born, what is the most lovely thing you can think of? And I said, crystals.

And it's always been my ambition to adorn one of my lectures with photographs of some beautiful crystals. Now I can assure you that these things form beautiful crystals and we sought some help in trying to get some photographs of these crystals but the fulsome and vainglorious promises of our professor of mineralogy at Harvard University that he could produce in vivid living color anything from a 35-millimeter slide to a gargantuan wall mural were empty. Hollow, and devoid of substance. What he actually produced would have disgraced the walls of a ninth house of easy virtue in Istanbul.

Well, no one can say that mine is a group in which where credit is due, it isn't given. Well, we had to work in this melancholy situation. We had to do our best, so let's look at a few of them.

This is a cluster of crystals of the synthetic normal F-nitrile. The photograph is pretty good considering that it's homemade, but it doesn't do the actual cluster of crystals justice. It really is magnificent.

Now, another view. That's another view of a cluster of crystals of the synthetic F-nitrile. See those marvelous faces? Planes, all that sort of thing. Very, very lovely. Professor Frondel looked at the sordid pictures that he had of these things and he said, oh it must be optically active.

Those are three photographs of crystals of the synthetic F-nitrile. Now here one sees a very interesting phenomenon. Here you see some of those very bold faces. This again is a cluster of these very bold prismatic structures interwoven with which are these finer prisms which have grown out from it. And if you looked carefully at some of the earlier structures, you would have seen little hair-like things starting out of this kind. Here, the process has further advanced than it had in the case of the normal synthetic compound. These are crystals of the F-nitrile derived by degradation from vitamin B12.

And again, one sees those very bold, with very well-defined faces, these rhombohedral structures interlaced in this case with the smaller ones, which are growing out from the earlier formed faces. So that's a second picture of the authentic, if you want to call it that, the material, the F-nitrile, crystalline F-nitrile derived from vitamin B12.

So there are the crystals. And I fulfilled my ambition to show some pictures of crystals of some things that we've synthesized and made.

# UV-Vis Spectral Comparisons

And so now let's go on to the more quantitative comparisons. Here on this slide, we have, I believe, the ultraviolet visible, the electronic spectra of the F-nitrile. And in blue, there is the spectrum of the synthetic material. And in red, there is the spectrum of the material derived from vitamin B12. And then over on the right, you put one on top of the other, and you get this curve. They are superimposable, exactly the same. That's the case for the comparison of the ultraviolet and visible spectra. The numbers, if you look at them, and the intensities are the same too, as well as the form, of course. The material derived from natural sources and the synthetic F-nitrile.

Here is the same comparison, the ultraviolet visible comparisons for the neo-compounds. Again, in blue, the spectrum of the synthetic material. In red, the material derived from vitamin B12, they are fully identical. When they're superimposed, one has the purple curve, which one sees here. You notice that there are some differences. If you remember anything about the character of the earlier slide, the just shown slide, you'll notice that the bands were better defined in this long wavelength region in the normal series than they are in the neo series.

# Circular Dichroism Spectral Comparisons

Now the next slide shows the comparison of the circular dichroism spectra for the F-nitrile, and again, the synthetic compound at the top, the compound derived from natural sources at the bottom, and the two put on top of one another in purple over here at the right. Again, they are clearly identical.

And shows the circular dichroism spectra for the neo-nitriles. Again, the synthetic, the material derived from vitamin B12, and the superposition spectrum. Now, in this case, I don't know how well your memory goes back to the previous slide, but you will perhaps have noticed that the spectra are very different. That is where the differences between the simple ultraviolet visible spectra for the normal and the neo compounds were minimal here they're markedly different. That is, the inversion of configuration at just that one center, C13, results in really utterly different circular dichroism spectra.

# IR and NMR Spectral Comparisons

Here are the infrared spectra, and you will not be surprised again to see that the infrared spectrum of the synthetic compound, that from natural sources, are identical. Here they are superimposed. That's for the normal compound. And the infrared spectra for the neo F-nitrile, the one derived by synthesis, the one from natural sources, they are identical. There is the superposition curve identical throughout.

On the next slide, now the proton magnetic resonance spectra at 100 megahertz. This is for the normal nitrile. These are spectra taken in benzene. And again, you can see that for the synthetic, for the material derived from natural sources, the spectra are identical. Here is the superposition spectrum. And you can see, although these are done mainly for purposes of characterization, you can see many of the main structural features. These are quite beautiful spectra. These are the ester methyl groups. And you see, you probably can't see, but there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And that's the number there should be. And over here are the saturated methyl groups, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And likewise, down here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

And what makes the thing a little more convincing is that there is a bit of water. You see, these are spectra done on the XL100 with something like 500 impulses. And so you see the tiny bit of water that's present, and it's at slightly different positions, as you can see in the superposition spectra. There are two water bands at slightly different positions but all the other bands are at the same position.

And here we have the proton magnetic resonance spectra for the neo F-nitrile, and again the picture is the same. The synthetic material, the natural material, and again the superposition. They are identical, all identical. And again, you can't pick out all the ester groups separately here. There are two of them in one of these bands, which is not resolved. But out here in the methyl region, one, two, three, four, five, six saturated methyl groups, you can look at them in any one of the three curves you wish because they're all the same.

# Mass Spectral Comparisons

Now the next slide. Here we have the mass spectra of the normal nitrile. They are essentially identical. As you know, mass spectra are notoriously susceptible to the precise conditions of the determination. And so on the mass spectra, I can make some special comments. One never sees the formula weight of these things. They lose the ligands too readily. And for all of these corrinoid substances, the main peak is a huge peak. You see it's divided here. It would be off-scale entirely. This peak at 929, in both, of course, the synthetic and the natural material, corresponds to the loss of cyanide, of hydrogen cyanide, and of methyl acetate. It's this one. We know it's that one, in fact, though I'll not go into the reasons that we know that.

Interestingly enough, we can see the doubly charged peaks here. Half of this very intense peak, 929, is really quite an intense doubly charged peak, and there's really an oddball peak out here at 1077. That's higher than the formula weight by quite a bit but we think we know what it is. It is in fact a species which is derived by the addition of an acetic ester unit to the cobalt in place of one of the cyano groupings. That's the case for the normal nitrile, the synthetic, and that derived from natural sources.

This is the case for the neo. And as it happened under the conditions that these determinations were done, we did not see the half peaks, that is the doubly charged peaks. And in the case of the neo compound, we didn't see this freak peak at that higher than the mass number. But that doesn't worry us in the least.

Now, that seems to me to be a fairly good case for the identity of the synthetic material with the material derived from natural sources. But you will realize that these are, what shall we say, these are glamorized spectra.

This is some of the raw data. This is the circular dichroism curves for the normal and neo-F nitrile, just as they appeared on the machine. Now you see the red line there that's going through the center of this is the baseline. It isn't very good, I regret to say. But this other line, that's the two compounds done at the same time. There's both a red and a black line there. I don't know whether you can see them, but they are both there. So that you see it isn't true that we see this remarkable degree of identity only in our glamorized slides. It's true if you look at the raw data also.

All right, now, there then seems to be quite a good case for the identity of the synthetic F-nitrile with the F-nitrile derived from vitamin B12.

# Nitrile to Amide Conversion Without Epimerization

Now, let us go on to the next slide. It was now necessary to transform the nitrile group into well ultimately a carboxyl group which is what is at that position in cobyrinic acid, our objective. And the first, you see here now we have again the two pictures of the normal and the neo-nitriles, and we now aver that we have established a pretty good case that the synthetic substance has the structure shown here in both the normal and the neo cases. And we now want to make further progress in the modification of that nitrile grouping.

Now, you will recall that I've already mentioned in discussing the preparation of the materials for comparison in the natural series, we've already mentioned one method for going from nitrile to amide, that is treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid. But that had a serious disadvantage, namely that C13 was equilibrated and that the equilibrium lay heavily on the side of the unnatural or neo-series.

So what we needed was a method for the conversion of nitrile to amide without equilibration at C13. And ultimately, a rather simple method for doing that was found here. The normal 3α, 8α, 13α F-nitrile is converted smoothly to the normal F-amide by treatment with boron trifluoride in acetic acid, about a 15% solution at about 74 degrees for an hour and a quarter. Now, there is virtually no crossover, no equilibration at the 13th position under these conditions, and so one can cleanly convert the normal nitrile into the normal F-amide, or, by the same token, the neo-nitrile into the neo-F-amide.

The overall reaction, of course, is in formal terms a hydration reaction. I suspect that it is not a hydration, but rather an equilibrium reaction. Nitrile plus acetic acid gives amide plus acetic anhydride. I think that's in fact what it is. In any event, this provides a simple and elegant process for conversion of the nitrile to the amide. And so in this way we were able to make the pure crystalline synthetic F-amides.

# Raw NMR Comparison of Synthetic and Natural F-Amides

Now, again, some of these comparisons, you may have been thinking that we've made them look better than they are. So I really want to convince you. And so I'm going to call on some of my very able assistants, Dr. Paone and Dr. Kronz, to do what you might call an experiment for us in connection with the normal F-amides, the normal F-amides here, crystalline substances prepared in the way outlined.

Now there is the synthetic normal F-amide. That is the actual spectrum, the proton magnetic resonance spectrum at 100 megahertz taken in chloroform, and this is a Xerox transparency of the actual spectrum directly from the machine. All right, and now there it is superimposed with the actual spectrum of the material taken directly from the machine in the same solvent on the material derived from the natural vitamin B12. And I think you will agree that the identity is satisfactory.

# Amide to Carboxylic Acid Conversion

Our problem now, you see, we've got as far as the F-amide, the hexamethyl ester F-amide, and we now must find a way to convert the amide to acid without hydrolysis of any of these six ester groupings.

Now, of course, traditionally, the way to convert an amide to an acid, which is essentially non-hydrolytic, is to use some form of nitrous acid. And many experiments were done in Zurich and in Cambridge, all to no avail. They all were frustrated by the fact that this 10 position of the corrin nucleus is very susceptible to electrophilic substitution. And so, for example, with nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate, there's immediate instantaneous substitution of that position by nitroso group. And these experiments were for a long, long time unsuccessful.

And in consequence of that, Professor Eschenmoser and his colleagues in Zurich worked out an extremely elegant selective way for the conversion of amide to acid, which is shown on the next slide. And I'm showing only the working portion of the molecule in which we're interested here. Here's the amide grouping, the F-amide.

Now, what the Zurich collaborators did was start with a chloronitrone. You see, a funny derivative. It's a condensation of hydroxylamine, of a substituted hydroxylamine with an aldehyde, in this case. And such substances have labile chlorine. It can be removed using silver tetrafluoroborate to give extremely reactive nitrosonium cations.

And when the chloronitrone, in the presence of silver tetrafluoroborate and the F-amide, when all these things are put together, this very highly active cation attacks the amide group, as you would expect at the oxygen atom, to give an intermediate salt of this kind. You see, this is a very strongly electrophilic reagent. The carbon attacks the oxygen and gives an intermediate of this sort.

Now, in that intermediate, the hydrolysis of the nitrogen double bond can be effected very readily with very dilute mineral acid. Both the nitrone grouping is hydrolyzed to give aldehyde here and the amino ether grouping is hydrolyzed to give ester. And so one gets an aldehydo ester as the product of the action of this highly electrophilic cation followed by mild mineral acid hydrolysis.

Now, when this aldehydo ester is attacked by, for example, dimethylamine, the dimethylamine does not attack the ester carbonyl group, but rather the aldehyde carbonyl group. To give something of this sort, once the dimethylamine O group has attacked the aldehyde group, then internally, there's an attack on the ester group, which leads to a transfer of that whole hydroxy aldehyde drooping over to this oxygen, and we get another ester. And now this is set up, you see, for elimination following these arrows to give the acid.

So in short, the overall result of the treatment of the aldehydo ester prepared in this way from the amide with the secondary amine is the acid. That is a diabolically clever method. Absolutely admirable. I can say that utterly without shame because I had nothing to do with it. It's Eschenmoser's method entirely and it's beautiful. It is, however, not quite as effective as the method shown on the next slide.

Elmar Krantz would have none of this nonsense that you couldn't use some form of nitrosation to effect the conversion of an amide to an acid, and so he found that dinitrogen tetroxide and carbon tetrachloride in the presence of solid sodium acetate at zero degrees for the right amount of time and in the right concentration resulted in the conversion of the amide directly to the acid in very high yield. So in fact, this method is somewhat preferable because it's very much simpler and yield I think is about the same overall.

Not only to primary amides but to secondary and tertiary amides so that while it is not the easiest way to accomplish our objective. In this case, it is something which should be kept very much in mind for this kind of problem.

Now, this then enabled us to transform the F-amide either by the nitrone method or by the direct dinitrogen tetroxide method into the F-acid. And now, you will notice that we are very close indeed to cobyrinic acid. All we need do is replace all six of these ester groups by amide groups.

# Challenges in Selective Ester Aminolysis

Conversion of an ester to an amide group is not generally thought of as a particularly complicated or difficult reaction. But we weren't all that sure that it would be particularly easy. You recall I've already mentioned that the acetic chains are quite highly hindered, and I'm sure that many of you here have encountered cases of esters which weren't all that readily converted into the corresponding primary amides. But in any event, we set about experiments to carry out that change, hoping that we might be able to do it fairly easily.

Now our first experiments were carried out not on this F-acid, but rather on the heptaester. That is, these were model experiments if you wish, we wanted to see if we could convert the heptamethyl ester of cobyrinic acid into the heptamide. And we treated the heptamethyl ester with ammonia and ethylene glycol at 75 degrees more or less 75 to 85 degrees for fairly long periods of time. And the results were very encouraging. We did get on paper chromatographic systems evidence of a material which seemed to be the heptamide of cobyrinic acid, behaved identically in many paper chromatographic systems, and that seemed a very promising result.

Now we then tried the same reaction on the F-acid, you see, which just has an acid group here, the rest carbomethoxy groups. With ammonia and ethylene glycol at about 80 degrees for long periods of time. And the reaction products seem to contain, admittedly not in very large yield, cobyrinic acid, the desired material, judging by paper chromatographic determinations, which were the standard for identification of materials in this series.

But it was just at this time that we became familiar with high-pressure chromatographic methods, and we found that this material, which seemed to be cobyrinic acid, and indeed the previous material from the heptaester, which seemed to be cobyrinic amide, was nothing of the sort. It was something entirely different. Where all of the paper chromatographic methods had failed to distinguish any difference between these products and cobyrinic acid and cobyrinic amide, the high-pressure chromatographic methods instantly showed us that we didn't have the right product at all, something entirely different.

# Discovery of Pseudocobyrinic Acid Formation

Well what was it? It was in fact the substance that I shown here on this slide starting with the F. One gets not cobyrinic acid, but pseudocobyrinic acid or dehydrocobyrinic acid.

Now, notice what has happened. It's a most extraordinary reaction, or seems to be at first sight. You see, what's happened is we formed a five-membered lactam ring here. Now, if there's one thing that's absolutely certain about the conditions under which these reactions were carried out, is that there was absolutely no oxygen present. Throughout all of this work, we have had to be at very great pains to exclude oxygen from our systems. The corrins, particularly under basic conditions, are exceptionally sensitive to oxygen. And we've had to use repeated freeze-drying procedures and so forth to exclude oxygen. That's one thing we know how to do is exclude oxygen from systems or we never would have been able to get to the point of giving this lecture tonight.

So there was no oxygen in these systems and yet this is an oxidation reaction, or seems to be. Let's imagine, for example, that this carbomethoxy group were transformed into an amide group. Then you can see that the formation of the lactam corresponds to that amide losing hydrogen with this, in other words, molecular hydrogen, to give this new carbon-nitrogen bond. And so it looks as though we have a reaction, C-O-N-H, H. H is going off as hydrogen and establishing a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

Well, that's precisely what I think happens. But, of course, it's not as simple as it appears at first sight. What one forgets is that this isn't just a simple bag full of amide or ester groupings. There is, in the center of this molecule lurking, this cobalt atom. Cobalt atom in valent state 3. It is an oxidizing agent.

And it is our belief that what happens here is that the Co(III) serves as an oxidizing agent for the formation of the carbon bond involved in the formation of this lactam grouping. And that brings the Co(III) down to Co(I), which can then react with an active hydrogen compound to give hydrogen, much as sodium reacts with water to give hydrogen. So we really do think hydrogen is the product, the other product from this reaction, though I confess we haven't looked for it and detected it.

# Mechanistic Insight on C8 Oxidations and Suppression Strategy

Now, you will also remember that I mentioned quite earlier in the lecture, in connection with the formation of these lactones, which we used for effecting the substitution in the 5 and 15 positions, that oxidations of this kind, that is at the 8 position, in the vitamin B12 series are not at all uncommon. And it looks very much as though, quite generally, this kind of thing is involved. That is, there's an oxidation-reduction relationship between the central cobalt atom and the C8 position of these corrinoid substances, which permits ridiculous things of this sort to take place.

Now, further, you remember that I said that the dimethylamide was a very useful substance for the formation of the lactone by iodine in acetic acid oxidation, whereas the corresponding ester was not. In other words, the better the nucleophilicity of the group which might participate in ring formation, the more easily and more readily such rings are produced.

Well, that line of thinking led to a very simple thought. Why not, well, first, perhaps an ionized CONH, CONH^-. Very powerful nucleophilic species is what is involved here, that we replace carbomethoxy by amide and then take a proton off of it to get CONH^-, and that then participates with the cobalt in an oxidation reduction reaction to give the new ring. And the way to avoid that would be to add some acid, which in this case would be ammonium chloride.

So to these mixtures of ethanolamine and ammonia, we added small amounts of ammonium chloride. Whether the idea that led us to use this is correct or not, I don't know. But the fact is that it suppresses the lactam formation completely, and then one obtains in a very short time, very much shorter time, a very simple and direct conversion of the F-acid to cobyrinic acid.

In other words, when the F-acid is treated with a mixture of ethanolamine and ammonia in more or less equal proportions in the presence of a catalytic amount of ammonium chloride in a few hours at 75 degrees, cobyrinic acid is formed in very high yield.

Now, I think whether the theory about suppressing the formation of the dehydrocobyrinic acid is correct or not, that's as it may be. I think one thing that is important here is that obviously the ammonium chloride is catalyzing the aminolysis of the ester. And so there's a useful practical hint for any of you who had difficulty in making esters into amides. Ammonium chloride in catalytic amount in ammonia, ethylene glycol is an excellent reagent for doing so.

# Achievement of Cobyrinic Acid Synthesis

So here was a way then of transforming the F-acid into cobyrinic acid, which as I mentioned before is or was our proximate objective. And indeed when we got to cobyrinic acid and its properties were identical with those of the natural cobyrinic acid, our work was essentially finished.

As we may note on the next slide I will remind you then that here is cobyrinic acid the substance whose synthesis I have described. Again the number of steps is a very hard thing to define. It comes out to be something like 82, I think. I really don't know. But I call to your mind also that in 1960 Friedrich, Gross, Bernhauer, and Zeller in Basel and Stuttgart transformed cobyrinic acid very simply into vitamin B12. Therefore in 1960 they completed our synthesis for us.

# Completion to Vitamin B12

There it is, vitamin B12 again in all its magnificence, and I think that, or at least I hope that I have here this evening presented evidence that we have completed an interesting synthesis of this exotic and marvelous natural product.

# Acknowledgements and Team Credits

Now, let me say again that tonight I have been acting as a spokesman for the two groups in Zurich and in Cambridge. This work has been done intimately in collaboration, and the achievement such as it is, is the achievement of both groups together. That of Professor Eschenmoser in Zurich and mine here in Cambridge.

Now also I should say that I've told only a small part of the story in the time available. One can do no more than that. I have said that these investigations were carried out by the groups of Professor Eschenmoser and myself. All Professor Eschenmoser and I did was more or less provide the facilities for the people that actually did the work and a certain amount of encouragement perhaps from time to time and maybe a little bit of planning thrown in.

Now altogether over a period of 11 years Professor Eschenmoser and I had 99 associates in this work. And they are, of course, the people who actually accomplished the synthesis. And it is to their credit very much so. They're a very devoted and skillful group of people.

I've described reactions very casually as though they just could be carried out by pouring things from one bottle to another, but in almost every case, almost every case, the reactions I've described had to be carried out under extremely carefully defined and prescribed conditions with all sorts of special precautions.

I may say also that much of the work which was done in exploring the ways to find the routes which were ultimately discovered was done on a very small scale on the order of 50 micrograms or so. When you're 75 steps away from home you don't want to use up much material in each experiment and you may have to do hundreds of experiments or even thousands. And so you use very small quantities of material. And when you want to exclude absolutely rigorously oxygen or moisture from a reaction on the 50 microgram scale, that's a chemist that can do that. And these men, whom I shall now show, starting with the next slide, are those who've done it. Ninety-nine, as I say, in all from nineteen countries.

Pride of place goes to the United Kingdom with twenty. And then perhaps not surprisingly with nineteen Switzerland. And then the United States plays third role here we are there are the big battalions from the United Kingdom from Switzerland and the United States with 20, 19 and 16 men. I'm not going to read their names I think they're written in large enough print so that you can see your name there a lot of them are here tonight and I want to thank them all personally for the tremendous contribution that they've made to the work.

Now, if we go on to the next slide, we come to some of the other countries. There's Japan with seven contributors and West Germany, I think, also with seven. Canada not far behind. Canada with six. India. Five. Free China. Australia. Still around. Far away. Austria. Not so far away. Soviet Union. Two, I think. And then we have Costa Rica. One. Just as big as all the others. Czechoslovakia. Fiji. I'll bet that shook you up. Fiji. France. Vive la France. Hungary. Ireland. Israel. And Jamaica.

Well truly an international achievement.

# Closing Remarks

There one more slide. Now, it may be hard to read this. What it says is, oh, stop complaining. It's an honor to be associated with an enterprise of this magnitude. Now, you see this? The natural material. Clearly recognizable, Professor Eschenmoser. And you know who that is.

Thank you very much. Thank you.

# Insights?

- **Absolute asymmetric synthesis**: Chiral centers in distant rings (A/D, B/C) required independent optically active building blocks with correct absolute/relative configurations, bypassing long-range induction.

- **Metal templating**: Zn²⁺ preorganized linear corrin for I₂/MeOH oxidative S-C coupling to thio-bridge, facilitating small-ring formation; facile exchange to CoCl₂/THF (vs. ineffective Co(ClO₄)₂/MeCN; charcoal "trick" revealed as HCl source for active CoCl₂).
- **Steric protection of enamine**: Bulky surroundings shielded C=N from O₃ or NaBH₄, enabling selective double-bond cleavage/reduction.
- **Labile centers (C3/C8/C13)**: α-proton acidity led to diastereomer mixtures; ~80% natural 3α bias (kinetic/precursor effect); HPLC (partition Zurich + adsorption Cambridge, up to 9k plates) resolved all 8 isomers/large lactones (MW>1000).
- **Reagent tricks**: Ms₂O for mesylate/nitrile without halide displacement; Ph₃P/TFA desulfurization; I₂/AcOH oxidation of 8-dimethylamide to lactone (participatory, stereofixing C8 cis-fusion).

- **Lactone bridge as multifunctional tool**: Sterically blocks C10 to prevent unwanted substitution while simplifying stereocontrol at C8/C3; enables selective top-face electrophilic attack at C5/C15.
- **Configurational selectivity in alkylation**: 3β blocks C5 substitution (steric hindrance from top-face approach); C13 epimerizes readily under reaction conditions (acidic, equilibrating), yielding ~80% 3α precursors for bis-substitution; implies top-face mechanism for electrophilic additions in corrins.
- **Bulky phenylthiomethyl handles**: Enhances stability, chromatographic resolution (mono/di/tri), and reductive desulfurization (Zn/AcOH → Me); diazomethane step resets C8-H stereochemistry reductively.
- **Co(III)/Co(I) redox in lactam formation**: Anaerobic "oxidation" at C8 via deprotonated amide nucleophile attacking Co(III), extruding H2 from Co(I); suppressed by NH4Cl acidification, revealing catalytic role in ester aminolysis.
- **Hindrance-directed aminolysis**: Propionic esters (unhindered) react preferentially over acetic (hindered) in mild NH3/MeOH.
- **Mild functional group interconversions**: BF3·AcOH for nitrile hydration to amide (no C13 epimerization, likely via acyl imidate); N2O4/NaOAc for direct amide → acid (simpler than Eschenmoser's chloronitrone/nitrosonium relay via aldehydo-ester/DMA cyclization-elimination).
- **Validation rigor**: Multi-modal spectroscopy (crystals, UV-Vis, CD highlighting C13 sensitivity, IR, 1H NMR with methyl counting/water impurity alignment, MS fragmentology) plus HPC retention; raw data overlays confirm no artifacts.
