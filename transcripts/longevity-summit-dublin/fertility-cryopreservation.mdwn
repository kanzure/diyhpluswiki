LLM-generated summary: Niamh Joyce presents a clinical overview of fertility preservation strategies for pediatric and young adult cancer patients at the Merrion Fertility Clinic in collaboration with the National Maternity Hospital and Children's Health Ireland, funded by the Irish Cancer Society. She details ovarian reserve dynamics from fetal development through menopause, emphasizing primordial follicle depletion and signaling pathways like PI3K and mTOR; the gonadotoxic effects of alkylating agents, chemotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant preconditioning leading to acute ovarian failure or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI); surveillance via AMH, antral follicle count (AFC), and ultrasound; and options including oocyte cryopreservation via IVF-like cycles with vitrification and ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) with cortex stripping, slow-freeze or vitrification, and orthotopic autotransplantation. A prospective study of 23 survivors showed 70% reassuring reserve but 30% warranting intervention, with stable AMH in most. Challenges in Ireland include lack of public funding, tissue banking reliance on UK hubs like Oxford amid post-Brexit barriers, and ethical considerations for elective OTC to delay menopause, highlighting live births from pediatric OTC while noting risks like malignancy reseeding.

# Introduction and Clinic Overview

Good afternoon, and thank you for welcoming me here. Thank you very much to Aubrey and Martin for the invitation to speak at the Longevity Summit here in Dublin.

My name is Niamh Joyce. I am an obstetrician-gynaecologist with a subspecialty fellowship in reproductive medicine, with a focus on fertility preservation and also working with a complex menopause cohort.

Today, I'm just going to briefly talk about a more clinical aspect of what we do in comparison to a lot of the brilliant scientific work that has been presented here today and possibly echoing some of the points that have been made by Miguel and Maria.

I'm going to talk about our cancer project for children at the Merrion Fertility Clinic, that's in conjunction with the National Maternity Hospital and Children's Health Ireland.

# Hospital Background

Just briefly going over ovarian development, physiology, and ageing; the effect of cancer on gonadal function; survivors of cancer treatment; and fertility preservation options that these individuals have.

This is our hospital with the red door in the front. This is the National Maternity Hospital on the south side of the city. The arrow there indicates where the Merrion Fertility Clinic is, and we work very closely together.

The National Maternity Hospital was founded in 1898 through charitable donations and delivers about 8,000 babies per year. The Merrion Fertility Clinic was then founded in 1988.

# Project Details and Patient Cohorts

Just a bit about our project. It has been funded very generously by the Irish Cancer Society. It allows us to address a cohort of patients that have no public funding or government backing.

We treat adolescents under the age of 18 who have active disease. They are post-pubertal children and young adults. They are about to undergo gonadotoxic treatment, and they have access to a bespoke treatment.

We recently have started then seeing survivors of childhood cancer, and these are people who are under the age of 27 but have been exposed to gonadotoxic treatment in their early life.

From here then we also have pre-pubertal children. For these children, we unfortunately are not able to offer them any services within Ireland, and they have to travel abroad. Our pre-pubertal children are supported very much so by Oxford University Hospital, and they support us in the development of our program as well.

So I will see biological females and males, but for the purpose of this talk, we'll focus on females. And in order to see them, they will have to be candidates who are about to undergo gonadotoxic treatment.

# Eligibility Criteria for Fertility Preservation

These are typically the most toxic treatments: hematopoietic stem cell transplants where they use alkylating agents that are irreversibly damaging to gonadal function.

These children have to be post-pubertal; they need to have an established menstrual cycle; they need to be clinically fit; and they have to have enough time to allow us to perform ovarian preservation before they have to start their treatment. This is not always the case, in which case, instead of going for egg freezing, they'll have to go for tissue freezing.

They have to be psychologically fit for the procedure. It is not to be underestimated how difficult this is for young children to go through, particularly when they are sick, and they have to have the support of their parents and the desire themselves to go ahead with this procedure. And again, they have to be under the age of 18.

Children at the age of 14 and above, or around the peri-pubertal stage, need to be discussed because of their high rates of aneuploidy, and the significance of that might be significant for egg freezing and the future use of those eggs.

With regards to survivors of childhood cancer, I will see these patients in a 30-minute consultation. They will have a pelvic ultrasound, and they will have an anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level check. And the outcome will be either that we recommend that they have annual surveillance or if they should go for fertility preservation.

And this is a leaflet that we give to patients.

# Ovarian Reserve Physiology and Ageing

So again, this is a picture of the ovary. The ovarian reserve is constituted of the primordial follicles. We've already heard that before in the last two presentations. It's established early in life, it declines throughout life, and it is a source of follicles for the entire reproductive span of an individual's or a woman's life.

This image here is very useful in that it demonstrates on the left side of the screen this gonadotropin-independent ovarian function, or follicular development. This is a stage where we don't really know a lot about this stage. This is where there are massive amounts of oocytes that are lost through an atresia process, and it's only then under the influence of FSH and LH that comes with puberty that the follicles are then recruited and grown to a stage of maturation, and then we also have a continued loss of ovarian reserve.

Within the oocyte itself, there are signaling pathways that become activated. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a very well-established and studied signaling pathway that activates the oocyte. Then in conjunction with the granulosa cells that surround the oocyte, the mTOR signaling pathway also activates cellular or follicle growth.

This graph here comes from a very well-studied paper by Wallace and Kelsey, and it basically illustrates the population of non-growing follicle populations throughout the lifespan or the reproductive lifespan from conception through to menopause.

At conception, the germ cells will migrate into the yolk sac around say four to six weeks, and then they will migrate back to the gonadal ridge. From there, there will be significant episodes of mitosis, where we have up to seven million oogonial cells that are clustered, and then they separate into primordial follicles. And there onward is a very wasteful process where these oocytes are consumed and are very atretic.

You can see here at birth we have—this says here 300,000—we believe there might be a bit more than that, but there is this downward decline. And you can see here the range between the different populations and densities. So each woman will have a variation of how much her primordial follicle density will be at the outset of birth. And that really does—this graph emphasises—that that dictates when the onset of menopause will occur.

From the same study, this graph also depicts the same message, but it clearly states that if you can see at the age of 15 down here below around that pubertal stage, a woman has lost about 50% of her reproductive pool. Then at the age of 30, there is this acceleration thereafter, but at 30, these studies that are based on histological analyses show us that there's about a 12% reserve left of the primordial pool, and then at 40 tragically about 3%, and not only then are we looking at low numbers but we have low quality, and there is no way that we can really identify the quality of eggs.

# Impact of Childhood Cancer Treatments

With regards to childhood cancer, childhood cancer has seen significant benefits in the sense that over the last number of decades there has been an over 80% five-year survival rate of children who have had childhood cancer. This is largely due to the fact that we have significant advances in chemotherapy and protocols that these children are put on.

However, as Maria mentioned, these are agents that target tissue non-specifically, and the ovaries and testicles are prime targets for these medications.

These are the type of cancer treatments that we have to consider when talking about fertility preservation: surgery, gonadal surgery, neurosurgery that affects the hypothalamus-pituitary and that will then affect the onward activation of ovarian function, and again radiation and chemotherapy. But most specifically are the stem cell therapy treatments that we have—not so much in the stem cell transplant itself but in the preconditioning treatments that come with alkylating agents. And those children are at significant risk.

This is just an overview of the effect of gonadotoxic therapy. On the left here you can see an ovary that is healthy; it's got growing follicles. Then the growing follicles are exposed to chemotherapy and they're destroyed, as is the stromal vasculature.

This is thought to happen between two mechanisms. There is a direct toxic effect of chemotherapy that causes DNA damage that may or may not be repairable, or there is an indirect depletion whereby the growing follicles are eliminated, AMH levels fall because we know that AMH is secreted by these growing follicles, and when we lose that inhibitory effect, the signaling pathways within the oocytes are accelerated, and this next wave of follicles come up and then they're also wiped out by this chemotherapy, and then that depletes significantly the primordial follicle pool.

The impact of this then is that there is acute ovarian failure. A girl may not have periods for a certain amount of time. They may recover over time if there is a follicular pool that's left there to be restored, or there's premature ovarian insufficiency, which is the equivalent of an early menopause in a young person, but probably has much more profound effects.

# Surveillance of Ovarian Function in Survivors

With regards to surveillance of ovarian function, we assess our survivors clinically, biochemically, and ultrasonographically.

So we establish whether or not their menses have returned. We look at their AMH levels because that's the most robust biological marker that we can use clinically. And based on ultrasound, we will measure ovarian volume, but more specifically the antral follicle count which we can see sonographically.

This allows us to understand whether a person is in ovarian decline or is an established failure, and it also helps us to inform women of their reproductive prospects.

With regard to AMH, as I said, it's really only interpretable in women who are over the age of 25. Limited data and the interpretation in young girls and adolescents—we know that it can help us to predict the time to menopause in older healthy women, and we use this as a guide when we are trying to identify young girls who are at risk of premature ovarian insufficiency.

And thankfully, due to advances in technology, the assays that we use now to detect AMH levels can detect at quite a low level, at 0.07 picomoles per litre, and when we're in that range, we know that these girls are at risk of premature ovarian insufficiency within two years.

# Prospective Study on Survivors

This is a study that was conducted in our survivors that we saw through our clinic. It was a prospective review of 23 females who benefited from the program. They were seen between the ages of 17 and 25 and had had cancer in childhood.

We did a baseline fertility assessment, which thankfully showed that 70% of these girls actually had a reassuring ovarian reserve. However, we identified that 30% may benefit from egg freezing in terms of protecting their reproductive health or reproductive potential.

And there was a correlation between AMH and AFC, which is established in the literature, and there was no correlation between age and the AMH or the antral follicle count.

We only saw 13 of these patients who followed up with us at the one- and two-year mark. And interestingly, and in keeping with the literature, AMH was actually stable in the follow-up. The women who have an ovarian decline, they're on an accelerated pathway, as one of our patients did with an AMH that fell from 35 to 15 picomoles, and she was recommended fertility preservation.

# Fertility Preservation Options Schematic

This is a schematic that we use. It comes out of Edinburgh, and they are really the gurus of fertility preservation in females. It just allows us to basically see that the options a female will have if she needs fertility preservation: post-pubertally she can have eggs frozen or embryos frozen, and pre-pubertally she needs to have ovarian tissue.

So fertility preservation is a process of freezing gametes or reproductive tissues prior to starting cancer treatment—ideally potentially after cancer treatment if in remission and if possible—so that a person can use them to have biological children in the future.

# Oocyte Cryopreservation Process

This is what we do at assessment: we perform an ultrasound. You can see the ovary down here on the lower part of the screen, and those little black circles are the antral follicles that we count per ovary. And then we do a series of hormone paneling including FSH, LH, anti-Müllerian hormone, and estradiol.

We then recommend egg freezing for a number of these patients. This is a cycle of IVF basically without the fertilization aspect. It was first employed in the 1980s. We know that rapid vitrification is a more effective freezing modality and has no longer been deemed experimental and is very standardized in social egg freezing.

Just a few words on human follicle development—I think it's valuable to understand how we work in the world of fertility preservation.

On the top graph there, you can see a spontaneous cycle. So there is this concept of the FSH threshold window. At the early part of the cycle, FSH rises and is maintained above a certain threshold for about a week. During that time, a number of follicles are recruited into the cycle, and feedback mechanisms with oestrogen will actually cause FSH to decline, and then we'll have the atresia of the majority of those follicles with only one dominant follicle developing.

To this you can see there—this here basically summarizes an IVF cycle—so we maintain, extend, and maintain the FSH level higher than physiologic doses and for a longer period of time, allowing all these follicles to develop here, and we can capture those through an egg retrieval process.

Below here is a graph that demonstrates how we used to think that females only had one cycle of follicular recruitment per cycle. But in fact, there are multiple waves; the majority of women will have two follicular waves, and some will even have three. And those are women with longer cycles.

This is important to understand, and particularly in the world of fertility preservation, where we're not worried about endometrial health and transferring an embryo because we're just freezing eggs for future use. And we can start this process at any stage in the cycle. So if someone is near ovulation, we can trigger them, we can ovulate that cycle, and then bring up the next wave. And that's very important in the sense of time. And it also allows us to do back-to-back cycles where we can maximize on the number of eggs that are available for freezing.

This here is just to show what it looks like at egg retrieval. There's a transvaginal ultrasound that we place into the woman's vagina. A needle is then guided into the ovary. You can see there that there's a stimulated ovary at the bottom part of the page; that white echogenic line is the needle that's in the follicle. We drain out the fluid, we pass it over to the lab, and hopefully the embryologist will be able to tell us that there is an egg visible or found in the fluid that we hand them.

This is an egg that our lab will find. They'll strip back the granulosa cells, and they'll just have the zona pellucida with the egg and a polar body—that's a metaphase II egg that has to be frozen. And they do this because it facilitates a more rapid freezing process, which it demonstrates here.

So the vitrification process is rapid, and it's done so with high concentrations of cryoprotectants that are thought to actually be toxic to cells. So this is an area of development that is very much in need to advance and make this process more efficient.

The cryoprotectants bind with hydrogen molecules of water. It prevents ice crystal formation. If ice crystals form, basically what happens is that it causes damage both osmotically and physically to the cell, and the eggs are no longer functional.

# Ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation (OTC)

The next option that women have is ovarian tissue cryopreservation. This is a surgical procedure. It doesn't come without risk. The tissue is removed, frozen, and can be thawed and used at a later date.

This here is just a cycle. I think it just summarizes it and breaks it down really well. We have a cancer diagnosis. We go for surgery. The person goes off and has cancer treatment, goes into complete remission, and then at a later stage, when wanting to use the tissue, can have it thawed and placed back into the abdominal cavity.

So the advantages of ovarian tissue cryopreservation is that there's minimum time delay. It takes a couple of days to organize. That's not without great effort, but we don't have to rely on the ovarian function to recruit follicles and store eggs. The added benefit of tissue is that when it is re-implanted, we can restore the endocrine function, and it can be offered to children and adolescents who are at risk of infertility.

It's no longer considered an experimental technique—unlike testicular freezing—because we have demonstrated that we have live births that have been born from this process.

The disadvantages, however, are that they are surgical, so surgery has a risk of intra-abdominal organ damage, hemorrhage, death—all things that really need to be considered, particularly in small people—and the risk of malignant contamination. So we are very hesitant to reimplant tissue if there's a diagnosis of ALL or leukaemia; this is because there's reintroduction of potentially malignant tissue.

And this is where maybe our naked mole rat might come in to help for helping us understand more about in vitro maturation and other ways to mature these eggs.

We use the Edinburgh criteria, which is a very robust tool in helping us to identify and select the appropriate person who is really at risk of developing premature ovarian insufficiency.

We can see that there are a number of people who have gone on to have ovarian tissue, but then subsequently have gone on to have spontaneous births, so maybe we haven't selected everyone appropriately.

According to the Edinburgh criteria, women need to be less than 35; they have to have no previous chemotherapy; they need a realistic chance of survival; they need to have a high risk of POI; and informed consent is very legally important. They need to have negative serology because they'll be sharing tissue banks with other people, so there is a risk of contamination. They need to not be pregnant and have no children.

This is an intraoperative image just to give you an idea of what it looks like. We have our uterus down low in the pelvis. This is an 11-year-old ovary that's being removed. It's called an oophorectomy for ovarian tissue cryopreservation purposes.

The suspensory ligament is where all the vessels that supply the ovary with its blood supply live, and we basically ligate that and dissect it off. I've just pointed out this pelvic sidewall here because this is an area that we might use for re-implantation in the future.

So it's important to understand what we're storing when we're talking about ovarian tissue. The ovary comprises two compartments: the medulla and the cortex. The cortex is kind of like the skin that surrounds the medulla, and there we have the primordial follicle pool.

So at the top graph here, we're removing the entire ovary, which is typically what happens in pediatric patients because they have a smaller volume of tissue, and it might be a safer procedure to do. We can remove part of the cortex, so sometimes we might take away half of the cortex of one ovary, so we might remove maybe 25% of the total ovarian cortex. And then I'm less familiar with this technique, but there's circular biopsies—I'm not sure what the advantage is to that.

Down here, what we have to do when we store tissue is we need to do a viability test to make sure that when we go to use the tissue in the future, that when we thaw these follicles have survived. At the moment, when we thaw tissue, we lose over 50 to 60% of the follicles that are there originally, so a 40% yield following the thaw process is considered successful or normal. And again, that comes down to probably toxicity and ischemia.

So when we go back to reimplant this tissue, there's a couple of different techniques we can use: the remaining ovary, where tissue can be tunneled underneath the remaining cortex or sutured to the outside of it. This has tissue fragments that may not be able to be sutured in a practical term to the ovary, and therefore they can be injected into the other ovary.

This here is the strips: so when we take the ovarian cortex, we literally slice it into small five-millimeter strips, and then we suture them onto the remaining medulla. So if the cortex has been taken off the ovary, when we go back a number of years later, we literally suture these grafts onto the ovary.

And then here you can see this is a pelvic sidewall that I demonstrated before. The tissue that lies above it is quite flimsy and easy to open; we literally chuck about a third of the ovarian tissue in there—it's not very scientific, unfortunately—and then we cover it up, and then lo and behold the tissue establishes itself over the next six-month period.

The graph here shows pre-transplantation of ovarian tissue where we have high levels of FSH because there's no estrogen to suppress that. We need that to be the case, so if the woman is on contraception, she needs to come off that because we're relying on the physiologic function of the pituitary gland to activate this tissue. And then you can see that over about a four- to six-month period, we begin to get the natural cyclical function back again, which is pretty exciting.

This woman was nine years of age when she had her ovary removed and frozen for beta thalassemia. She had to undergo stem cell transplant and she was rendered sterile but went on to have a baby through ovarian tissue and IVF.

And this is just another—the first case that was done—again, showing that stem cell transplant really does cause significant injury.

# Challenges in Ireland

So this is just a little bit of information about how we operate here in Ireland. We do not have a tissue bank here. We recently have received government funding for general fertility and IVF, but we have no support for pediatric or childhood fertility preservation, which is shocking.

We are part of—or have been included historically—into the hub-and-spoke model of the UK, which we are not a part of, let's be clear. But Oxford very much facilitates this for us. So we can have tissue that—I suppose we have had one tissue that was removed here and then sent to Oxford. But since Brexit, these things have become very difficult. And now our patients have to travel to the United Kingdom. And when these children are sick, it becomes very cumbersome. And now as we are no longer a commissioning site of these Oxford sites or Edinburgh, children will now have to pay up to 30,000 pounds sterling if they wish to have this procedure done.

This is the pathway that we have to follow. So just practically, we have to identify the patient, refer them, they have to go through a consent process, surgery, tissue, and then the process of having them put back in the future.

This is just a picture of a team at surgical collection here, removing the ovary at one of the spoke sites, and then the tissue is packaged. It's put into a validated shipping container so it can travel on ice for 24 hours before it needs to be processed and frozen, and then it makes its way to the centre of interest, which is either Oxford or Edinburgh, where they have a tissue stem cell clean room.

It's essential that we have a grade A air quality clean room in order to facilitate the process of this tissue. There has to be a Human Tissue Authority license in order to facilitate this treatment and make sure that this is a validated process.

And these are just some images here of what tissue actually processing looks like. It's not technically very difficult, but it is ethically very sensitive.

So we have an ovary here, and this is when it arrives into the grade A air hub. Over here, this is an embryologist or scientist that's basically cutting the cortex off the medulla. Down here, the cortex—it is now just spread out and it's been getting ready for processing. This is the tissue in here that's cut into small little bits, and there may be primordial follicles floating around in that fluid as well, so we like to capture those and freeze those. And you can see here how small those strips really are.

And again, this is just the cryopreservation, and that we need to have tissue cryopreservation and tissue authority involved in this. And then they have to be re-transplanted in the sites where the tissue is stored because unlike the freezing process where you have 24 hours, you only have 20 minutes to transplant this tissue.

# Elective Ovarian Cryopreservation to Delay Menopause

I came across this interesting paper by Oktay and colleagues. He's active in the space of fertility preservation, and I thought it might be something that would be interesting to talk about.

And the question is: can elective ovarian cryopreservation also be used to extend the duration of reproductive function and delay the menopause?

If you look at the top graph here, this is presuming that we have 100% primordial follicle survival following the freeze-thaw process—when we are nowhere near that. But if you look at the decline, and if a woman at the age of 30 has her ovarian tissue removed—about 25% of that—she should, I suppose, predictably go through a normal menopause. Just before she does, the idea is that we reimplant this tissue and she goes back to normal function. And that tissue can last up to 11 to 12 years. So when we reimplant tissue, we do it in thirds. So technically, she will have over 30 years of reproductive function and hormonal support for the rest of her life.

The graph below here shows a more realistic, I suppose, trajectory: that at the age of 30 with a 40% survival, she may have seven years of delayed menopause.

But there are clinical implications to consider here. There's the risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancers; there's benign gynaecological issues that have to be considered. Does this woman have a healthy pelvis before she had ovarian tissue removed? The presence of endometriosis, PCOS—did her periods wreck her life before she went with menopause? Fix that with a reintroduction of exogenous hormones? These are real practical things to consider, in addition to the surgical risks and making sure that we're selecting the appropriate patient and somebody that has an accelerated ovarian decline. Are we going to be then putting this person into a premature menopause because we have removed her ovary?

So at the moment, this is not supported by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine nor by the European Society. It is only advised for the replacement for fertility and not for hormonal function. We have exogenous treatments to address this that can also benefit the time of perimenopause, which is probably the time that wreaks the most havoc in women's lives, and then the long-term benefit of cardiac and bone protection.

However, this important study—this study is very important because it does, I suppose, address the questions that we need to answer. Where is the value? Do we need to look at ovarian tissue in an experimental context or in a scientific context and get information for that, and then use technology to replace its function?

Thank you very much for your attention. It's a pleasure to speak. Thank you.

# Q&A

**Q: Radical ovarian tissue freezing for lifelong fertility and hormones?**

Great talk. That's a great talk. And I mean, I think as a menopausal woman, I'm listening to all the things that you discuss and maybe that's why I'm asking so many questions. But let's think about this huge difference between biological males and females. By the time I'm 35, I'm going to have to scramble to find a mate, to have a litter of children. It's going to wreck a scientific career or any other career really. And I'm looking down the lens towards 40 years in absolute bits unless I get hormone replacement.

But you suggested that the idea that, all right, this radical approach of taking ovaries when you're much younger, freezing them and then re-implanting them when you're older is for fertility. But could we take ovaries from an eight-year-old, an eight-year-old me, and then when I'm hitting 40, 50, re-implant it and I could keep on having kids? And so, and is this a way, because I said, you can only do it—it's not to replace hormones, but it's for fertility. Why should we stop having children when we're 40, 50, if we want to?

**A:**

That's an excellent question, thank you very much. Very happy to take that.

So are you going to go through an unnecessary surgical procedure at the age of eight for who knows what? Okay, that's one thing.

Tissue is very exciting. I think it's new, it's novel, it's got stem cells. It's really exciting. But in the reality of it all is that we also need to think about the way we look at ageing as well and the message that we're sending women.

And I feel very passionate about this because we're encouraging women to freeze their eggs, to take all these interventions so they can have their kids later on in life. But what people don't really understand, and it's the obstetrician in me, is that I would hate to see a 50-year-old—and I do hate to see a 52-year-old with twins coming in through the door because she had a donation; she's got cardiovascular problems, she's going to have preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, diabetes, and then the implications of all of that on preterm birth, being left with a very disabled child that society now needs—I mean, it goes on.

So I think that is not the reason why we do that. I think it's fertility in the appropriate context. And it's those who are genuinely at risk. And cancer is a growing cohort of people. I think our chances are significant that we're all going to have cancer. I think it's one in two.

So as we see childhood survivors, these are the kids that need to be minded and looked after. And this is where the longevity space will actually change their lives because they will live a normal lifespan, but it will be in bits. So yeah, and I think 70% of these kids will have some late effect, fertility being one of them. Thanks.

**Q: Best age for elective egg freezing?**

Hello. So what would be the best age to freeze your eggs if you're like an older woman and thinking about having children later? And is there a time frame for freezing? Thank you.

**A:**

Yeah, that's a very good question. And I think I [am] seeing more and more young women coming through our clinics who are being proactive about freezing their eggs, and it is a really good security blanket to have. But there's no guarantee that that will give you a baby.

So if you're going to have a baby from a frozen egg, you'll need to freeze at least about 18 to 20 eggs because each oocyte will give you about a 5% chance of a live birth—so that's not very high. And then you've got your male factor as well. So we're going to meet somebody that's got very poor sperm quality; what is the embryology; how much can you troubleshoot? So we're freezing eggs—it's not a free-for-all that your reproductive prospects are intact.

The best age to do that would probably be late 20s, I would say maybe early 30s, but late 20s would be the best time. Too young—you know, women under the age of 21—they have very high aneuploidy, so a lot of these cells are abnormal, and we don't know enough about that. But as we are working with childhood cancer and survivors of childhood cancer, we'll begin to know more about that down the line.

# Intuitions

- **Primordial Follicle Pool Dynamics**: Fixed at birth (~1-2 million, declining to ~300,000), dictates menopause timing; 50% lost by puberty, 88% by age 30, 97% by 40; quality declines in parallel without reliable assessment.
- **Gonadotoxicity Mechanisms**: Direct DNA damage to follicles/stroma; indirect via AMH drop removing inhibition, accelerating PI3K/mTOR-driven primordial recruitment and burnout.
- **Surveillance Trick**: AMH <0.07 pmol/L predicts POI within 2 years; stable in most survivors but accelerates in at-risk; correlates with AFC, independent of age post-treatment.
- **Oocyte Cryopreservation Insight**: Leverage multi-wave follicular recruitment (2-3 waves/cycle) for random-start, back-to-back cycles to maximize yield without endometrial concerns; vitrification superior via cryoprotectant dehydration preventing ice crystals, though toxic at high concentrations.
- **OTC Advantages/Tricks**: Minimal delay (days); restores endocrinological function via pituitary reactivation; pediatric viable (live births from age 9 tissue); cortex-only strips (5 mm) for storage/reimplantation (orthotopic: ovary tunnel/suture, sidewall pocket); 40% post-thaw yield benchmark despite ischemia/toxicity losses; Edinburgh criteria for selection (age <35, high POI risk, no prior chemo).
- **Ireland-Specific**: Hub-spoke reliance on UK (Oxford/Edinburgh) post-Brexit adds costs/travel; no local tissue bank/cleanroom.
- **Elective OTC Intuition**: Sequential 1/3 reimplantation could extend function 30+ years (optimistic 100% survival) or ~7 years (realistic 40%), but risks (malignancy, surgical, pelvic pathology) outweigh unless accelerated decline; not endorsed for hormones (use HRT).
