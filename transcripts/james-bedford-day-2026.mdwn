# Welcome and Announcements

Welcome to the Church of Perpetual Life, our live stream. I'd like to welcome you here on January 15th. Tonight we are celebrating James Bedford Day, which is often recognized on January 12th. And on this date, the city of Hollywood, Florida, has a proclamation in effect every year for this date to state that the city recognizes this day every year to be a celebration of James Bedford, the first person to be cryopreserved.

Before we begin our program, I'd like to let you know all about our regular service. It's typically on the last Thursday of the month, as it will be this month. And so from January through May, we will have a hybrid and in-person event in Zoom, live stream, YouTube, as well as in person, except April. April will be online only. So visit with us this month. It'll be January the 29th. And this month, we're pleased to have Dr. Kahn and Bill Faloon giving presentations. Dr. Kahn will be giving a presentation on the war against heart attacks, and Bill Faloon will give us an age reversal update. And so please mark your calendars this month for Thursday, January 29th. The social hour will be at 6 p.m., and the main event will start at 7 p.m. Come in person or come online.

I'd also like to remind you that Rudy Hoffman will have his monthly Zoom tomorrow at 12 noon. If you like to connect with other cryonicists from around the world, you can contact Rudy Hoffman to access this event. It's the third Friday of every month, and he will have the lead researcher for Ray Kurzweil, who is John Clark, speaking about super artificial intelligence and the singularity. So contact Rudy Hoffman or contact me and I'll put you in touch with Rudy if you'd like to go to his Cryonics event, which is the third Friday of the month.

# Perpetual Life Creed

Now please join with me to read the Perpetual Life Creed.

We believe that all of life is sacred and that we have been given this one life to make unlimited. We believe in our creator's divine plan for all of humanity to have infinite lifespans in perfect health and eternal joy, rendering death to be optional.

By following our prophets, we achieve eternal life, creating a heaven here on earth.

We follow Nikolai Fedorov, who taught that the transcendence of the Creator will be solved only when humanity, through our unified efforts, become an instrument of universal resuscitation, when the divine word becomes our divine action.

And we follow Arthur C. Clarke, who said the only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible.

And so we enter each day energized in spirit and empowered by the words of our prophets to live in joy, serving our creator and human race forever and ever.

# Introduction of Speaker: Ben Best

Our speaker tonight is Ben Best, who is the Secretary Treasurer here at the Church of Perpetual Life. And he's the founder and the creator of this cryonic celebration of James Bedford Day. It was Ben's idea, and we're so glad to have him now. This is his 12th year anniversary celebrating Bedford Day here at Perpetual Life. And Ben has led this event every year. He's also one of the founders of the church.

So I'd like to share a little bit of information about Ben's history with you. Ben Best is an icon in the American cryonics movement. He was president and CEO of the Cryonics Institute, one of the world's largest cryonics organizations, for nine years between 2003 and 2012. Ben holds undergraduate degrees in pharmacy from the University of British Columbia and physics and computing sciences and finance from Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada. Ben Best is also certified as a professional registered parliamentarian by the National Association of Parliamentarians, and he currently travels all around the world attending age reversal conferences and meetings with researchers working on reversing human aging.

So please help me welcome Ben Best to our 12th annual celebration of James Bedford Day.

# Remembering James Bedford

So January 12th is Bedford Day. He's the first person ever cryopreserved, and he's still being preserved, and he's been in cryopreservation for 59 years. And that's Bedford.

He wrote to Robert Ettinger in June '66, saying he was dying of liver cancer. He was preserved at the age of 73 on January 12, 1967. And he's currently at Alcor being stored in liquid nitrogen.

And this is the guy who coordinated the freezing, Robert Nelson, president of the Cryonics Society of California (CSC). He wrote a bunch of books about the subject. And the equipment set up to preserve Bedford, but the apparatus wasn't ready, so it was injected with DMSO 1,500 times for the carotid arteries, and he probably got some antifreeze.

And the family didn't trust Robert Nelson or the Cryonics Society of California to handle Bedford for more than a few days, and that was good judgment because all the CSC patients perished to bad judgment and times were mismanaged by Robert Nelson. By 1979, all the other CSC patients had been thawed or buried or cremated, and the loss of this was equivalent for cryonics to the Challenger disaster of the space shuttle explosion.

Anyway, his patient dry ice for several days, maintained liquid nitrogen by his family, moved to Trans Time in '67, and then back to Alcor, and transferred to Alcor in 1982. And they've been there ever since. And his examination of his body in 1981 indicated he'd been frozen the whole time and no re-warming had occurred in that period.

So happy Bedford Day everybody. This is the major cryonics holiday of the year. Forget about Christmas and New Year's. This is the big one we all celebrate.


# Cryonics Research Updates

So I don't see any questions at the moment. Let's go ahead and go forward. If there's any questions, we can also come back. We can have more time for questions at the end.

So next I want to talk about cryonics-related research.

## BRLS Funding Overview

So I'm Director of Research Oversight for BRLS, which is Biomedical Research and Longevity Society. And we spend roughly 8 to 9 million dollars funding cryonics-related research, more than any single funding source.

## Biostasis Technologies (BT)

So one of the organizations we're funding is Biostasis Technologies, which is headed by Aswin DeWolf, and its mandate is development of technologies and standards for cryonics procedures, full-time case review analysis, scientific advice, education, and training.

Now, you see the initials SST often. I'll mention them, so I might as well define them right here and now, in case you haven't heard those initials before.

SST: Standby, Stabilization, Transport.

When a client is dying, a client's team comes to the patient's bedside and waits for the patient to die. That's the S part, standby.

After the patient is declared dead by a medical professional, it begins cooling, chest compression, artificial ventilation, and stabilization medications to suppress metabolism. That's the S part for stabilization.

And once the patient has been stabilized the patient is transported in ice or dry ice to the cryonics organization located in another state or country. That transport.

So faster cooling is better. Ischemia is tissue damage due to lack of blood circulation. Faster cryopreservation cooling, the less ischemic damage occurs in tissues.

Cooling in ice baths is faster than cooling with ice bags. But circulating cold water is faster than just ice bath cooling.

And this shows the discharge, an old Alcor chart showing the difference. The top shows just using ice bags. The middle is showing ice bath. And the lower is actually circulating the water.

And one thing BT has brought in this innovation is not only circulating the water around the patient, but circulate the water under the patient. So the patient's actually lying, otherwise the patient would, their backs would be on the table and they wouldn't be getting any benefit of the circulating water. Anyway, that's one innovation we can thank BT for.

But internal cooling is faster than external cooling. But you can put a cold fluid in the blood vessels, but that requires surgical access to blood vessels, which takes time and requires a standby surgeon.

A better way of doing this would be liquid gas mixture through the lungs, which could be done rapidly without requiring surgery.

So this is the kind of surgery that you do for intracooling. And liquid ventilation achieves intracooling by cold liquid through the lungs and avoids surgery.

Now, this is just a theoretical chart. On the left-hand side, we see the very rapid cooling. But this is only theoretical. This has actually been achieved in practice. And that's what we're trying to do is achieve this in practice.

And this is a guy building a machine to do that, Charles Platt. He's also built a lot of good ice baths that are portable and fold up and easily transferred.

Now, the head of BT has come up with this S-mix, a measure of ischemic exposure. And we ideally have zero minutes of ischemia. That's perfect. Zero. An S-mix of zero is a perfect score.

And he applied the S-mix standard to all the cryonics patients of Alcor and determined the best S-mix scores were the ones done in Arizona were close to Alcor. So rather than the fly-in and deploy model. So it's best to be right near the cryonics facility.

So liquid ventilation, this is an example. These are pictures. Anyway, theoretical estimates of 0.22. It's pretty close to zero. And the pacing could be 7 degrees Celsius after one hour and 22 degrees Celsius after 20 minutes.

Anyway, these are pictures of the liquid ventilation machine. But we were hoping to get this testing in 2025. But Charles Platt, because these things need to be air transported and there's the people in the airline industry are known for their gentle handling of baggage so we had to rejigger the device to make sure it was able to handle this rough handling.

So anyway, 2026 we may do liquid ventilation but dummies and cadavers haven't proved to be a way to do this. We need to use live patients. The cadavers are already cold. They need to be warmed up in order to do the liquid ventilation. That's not a reasonable thing to be doing.

So the agreements that made with Cryonics Institute to provide free SST services to terminal Cryonics member who has not arranged for SST but is willing to be a test subject and similar arrangements have been made with Tomorrow Biostasis.

## Resurgent Biomedical (RBS) and Suspended Animation (SA)

Now another organization being funded by BRLS is Resurgent Biomedical and also Suspended Animation. And Houston Westfall is the executive officer he on this call and he can answer any questions he might have after I finished my presentation.

But anyway the Suspended Animation is based in California and SST services applied to Alcor the Cryonics Institute throughout the United States based on the fly-in and deploy model in which the SA team flies to the location of the patient provides SST includes washing the blood with organ preservation solution and shipping the patient to a cryonics facility in ice and then...

RBS, Resurgent Biomedical, is based in South Florida with branches in New York and California. SST includes perfusing the patients with vitrification solution and shipping in dry ice to a cryonics organization. That's one of the options.

RBS is operating an SA facility in Boynton Beach, both SA and RBS employ perfusion.com for surgery and perfusion.

RBS may employ a fly-in deploy model for locations other than South Florida. It's currently providing services for Tomorrow Biostasis in the United States and it's negotiated with Cryonics Institute for providing vitrification solution, perfusion, and shipment dry ice costing $18,000 more than suspended animation services.

To date results with two Tomorrow Biostasis patients handled by RBS in New York City. Tomorrow Biostasis CEO Emil Hansen has given authority to choose an SST executive for RBS approved by the RBS board of directors.

So also, RBS has long-term leased cryogenic medical brands to provide hospitals to advance anti-aging medical services and CPS.

## 21st Century Medicine (21CM)

The largest organization which is being funded by BRLS is 21st Century Medicine, run by Greg Fahy. It's got a lot of staff.

The main aim is to produce rabbit kidney with vitrification the kidney cryogenic temperatures rewarm the kidney transplant to rabbit with full function. And they want to do the same with pig kidney and eventually human kidneys.

So vitrify means glassify. This is a way of preventing ice formation. And just like glasses, it's a cool syrup. If you watch a glass blower making glass it's a syrupy rather than a crystalline form which is what you're trying to get you don't want crystals.

So it's in case my cryoprotection is not called the mechanical damage of ice but and it's a means of storing organs below cryogenic temperature without ice formation.

So this is what on the left you see a frozen kidney that all looks like a snowball and on the right a vitrified kidney looks like a perfect kidney preserving glass.

And to get the avoidance of the ice formation you've got these cryoprotectants and these cryoprotectants interfere with the hydrogen bonding in water and that's how they prevent ice formation but unfortunately they're toxic and if the toxicity could be reduced transplanted organs could be stored at low temperature and cryonics patients could be more easily preserved at cryogenic temperatures without ice formation.

Challenges that prefer preserving tissues and organs with CPAs is to use enough CPA to prevent ice formation, but not so much as to cause ice damage by CPA toxicity. If this toxicity didn't exist, CPAs could be used in larger quantities without worrying ice formation and cooling.

So this has been the life's work of Greg Fahy.

Kidneys are the most transplantable human organs, but the demand is greater supply, and most patients waiting for a transplant die waiting. So being able to vitrify and store kidneys at cryogenic temperatures would meet a great medical need a proof of principle of cryonics.

And M22 is the cryoprotectant developed to 21st Century Medicine and used by Alcor for cryolex patients.

So here part of the problem is that and when you vitrify, use cryoprotections and cool to below -90 degrees or in the temperature range of minus 120, at that low temperature this ice nucleation is formed. There's no ice nucleation at minus 140. Anyway, ice growth is maximum at higher temperatures when nuclei can cause their problems.

So what this chart indicates is when you're cooling, when you're cooling there's no problem with ice formation. But when you're re-warming, you've got all these nuclei that were formed at low temperature, and these nuclei can cause ice growth. So we need to rewarm very rapidly. The rewarming is the challenging part of this process, not the cooling part.

So Brian Wowk has developed a radiofrequency rewarming for kidneys. And hard warming rates can mean lower and less toxic concentrations of M22, M22 can be used.

So this is a chart sort of indicating a maximized growth and the benefits of radiofrequency warming. And it shows the difference between the kidney cortex, which is the least vulnerable, and the inner medulla of the kidney, which is the big problem. It shows the difference between conductive and RF rewarming.

So actually, M22 has recently found some light-duty toxic cryoprotective agents, and they're being tested to replace M22 in certain combinations for improved cryoprotection.

And Ralph Spindler is the guy doing rapid brain preservation in 21st Century Medicine. And he's shown preserved ultrastructure by opening the blood-brain barrier with detergent so that the cryoprotectant too can get in the brain. And this is his latest achievement showing these ultrastructure with his latest protocol.

But also EEG is a better measure of preservation in the ultrastructure and we've demonstrated retention of EEG.

Now intermediate temperature storage is a way of we know at dry ice temperature organs and patients can experience a cracking due to the, but this cracking, this cracking does not occur at intermediate temperature storage. This is called intermediate temperature storage.

And so 21st Century Medicine has built a four-person ITS unit for European Biostasis, which stores patients with Tomorrow Biostasis.

And this is the first whole body ITS unit ever built and it was really the original completion date is 2024 the aluminum frame wasn't received until August '25 but it was finally completed in December '25 and as Saul Kent once memorably said everything takes longer than you expect except aging. My favorite Saul Kent quote.

Anyway, these were the steps to complete the ITS unit and it's finally been, it's been, all these steps have been completed in development but it still needs to be shipped to Switzerland.

So in 2026 wants to apply for a patent of new cryoprotectant. Things are looking good with this new cryoprotectant. He finally going to be able to achieve the goal of all these decades of research to try to perfuse rabbit kidneys, to cool them cryogenic temperature, rewarm them, and transplant them back into rabbits.

Another big breakthrough was Greg Fahy wrote an article to be published soon that documents brain tissue preservation by alcohol patient Dr. Stephen Coles, refuting the claims of aldehyde stabilized cryoprotectant proponents that brain ultrastructure, the connectome, is not preserved by cryonics procedures.

Paper will demonstrate to the world that it will. But he's not going to submit this to Cryobiology. That journal is pretty hostile to cryonics, but he's submitting to Plus One journal.

## Dr. Rudolfo Llinás Research

Anyway, Dr. Rudolfo Llinás, who's also on this call, Paul is also a beneficiary of BRLS funding, and you can ask him questions after I'm finished talking about his research.

And he first started working with C. elegans worms, and he used magnetic nanoparticles to increase the survival of C. elegans.

And actually the magnetic nanoparticles have been used to achieve with rat kidneys what Greg Fahy has been trying to do for years with rabbit kidneys. Rabbit kidneys are a lot larger than rabbit rat kidneys, so it's more challenging. But the rat kidneys were rewarmed with iron nanoparticles.

So Dr. Llinás's plans for 2025, well in 2025, he loaded five mouse hearts with cryoprotectant, cooled them minus 60 degrees rewarmed them with three of the five hearts beating within seconds of reperfusion.

So for 2026 Dr. Llinás is going to remove mouse hearts perfuse them with UW preservation solution used in organ transplants and perfuse them with cryoprotectant-assain containing magnetic oxide nanoparticles, MCPA calls it, and follow that hearts and cold store requiring temperatures following which the mouse hearts are rewarmed and heated and the vitrified mouse hearts containing mouse MCPA rewarmed with alternating magnetic fields rather than the RF used by 21st Century for rewarming rabbit kidneys.

If applied to human hearts which would gain total storage time from four hours to unlimited storage time.

## FANT Labs

So another recipient of BRLS funding is Alexandra Stolzig. She's a distinguished professor and she works in, she has FANT Labs that works within 21st Century Medicine.

She was inspired by Yale research, which was able to store pig brain metabolism four or eight hours after the pigs died. By improving the perfusion solution, FANT Labs has maintained pig brains for 16 hours after the pigs died, possibly stopping cell death after nine hours and restoring electroencephalogram (EEG) signals not done by the Yale study.

In 2026, FANT Labs wants to add mitochondria or exosomes to the perfusion solution. And these protocols could be applicable to enable recovery of brain tissue in stroke victims.

## Advanced Neurobiotic Sciences (A&B)

So, the last organization that I'm going to discuss receiving BRLS funding is A&B, Advanced Neurobiotic Sciences, which is also like BT, run by Aswin DeWolf.

And they've got a nice laboratory and their head of operations is Susan Dennis, skilled in rat microsurgery.

The big news is that CryoDAO a decentralized autonomous organization that funds cryo-projects, they created $900,000 to Aswin DeWolf for research aimed at whole body cryopreservation of rats.

As Rudy mentioned earlier in this call, this has been a dream of actually cryopreserving a whole mammal. And people keep, even Peter Thiel was advocating this, but the barriers to doing this.

But anyway, I think it's allowed A&B to acquire equipment. They always use A&B research, including a cooler that can cool to liquid nitrogen temperature at a controlled cooling rate.

But the major piece of equipment that they've gotten is the micro-CT scanner, a CT scanner that's used in RAS. And this CT scanner can allow for monitoring of distinct organs as perfusion proceeds.

And the micro CT scanner is so large and heavy that it can only be placed in the A&B foyer. They couldn't move it anywhere else in the building. It's in the foyer at all.

So here's the, on the left you see the micro CT scanner. And these are all the five A&B staff members in the meeting, in the foyer.

And so VM1 is used by Cryonics Institute and Tomorrow Biostasis, whereas M22 is used by Alcor for vitrification solution. M22 is optimized for rabbit kidney slice, whereas VM1 was optimized for rat brain hippocampal by Dr. Yuri Pichugin.

A&B is researching the properties of cryoprotectant VM-1, which will also be published in a peer-reviewed journal in 2026.

The 21CM cryoprotectant M22 has multiple peer-reviewed journal publications, but VM-1 has none so far. M22 is very expensive, whereas VM-1 is not expensive. VM-1 has shown good stability in dry ice, whereas M22 readily forms ice and dry ice temperature.

This makes VM1 valuable for field cryoprotection prior to shipment in dry ice to a cryonics facility.

And that's my presentation.

# Q&A

And we have a few questions for you. Thank you very much.

First off, is M22 considered the best product to use at this time?

Well, you get different opinions. Aswin might say VM1 is better and Greg Fahy would say M22 is better.

Okay, fair enough.

Question first from Rudy. I wonder if you could talk about the toxicity of CPAs at various concentrations and temperatures. Do you know if the new CPA 21st Century Medicine's developing has a lower toxicity?

This is a question still being researched.

One of our projects is to compare M22 with VM1 in various circumstances, you know, because a very critical question because you know as they say Tomorrow Biostasis says uses and Cryonics Institute uses VM1 whereas Alcor uses M22 and so there's a lot of strong feelings involved and 21st Century Medicine claims they're the only people who can do a proper comparison, but A&B is going to do their own comparisons, and they may come up with similar.

But anyway science should be objective and we should get an objective answer to this question. But this is one of the topics being funded.

Okay another question Ben could you identify what the bottlenecks are to reversible organ cryopreservation and viability for mainstream medicine? Any thoughts on that?

Yeah, cryoprotectant toxicity. You want to use enough cryoprotectant to prevent ice formation, but not enough to get toxic effects.

And 21st Century Medicine has found some new, a new cryoprotectant, which is much less toxic and seems to have better perfusion capabilities. And they're very hopeful of having maybe a breakthrough in the first quarter of 2026.

Right.

Another question, would cohesive collaboration among the various laboratories doing cryo research improve the odds of breakthroughs and prestigious journal publishing in your opinion saying that in other words cooperation that is BRLS and BT I think cooperate very closely but you know Houston can comment on that as being directly involved and I believe I would encourage cooperation between A&B and 21st Century Medicine.

Aswin DeWolf is scheduled to visit 21st Century Medicine to experience fish and the work that Ralph Spindler is doing with rabbit brains.

And Bill Faloon is also pushing, has been pushing cooperation between 21st Century Medicine and Alcor. But I think as far as I'm being told by Greg Fahy and Brian Wowk that that's already occurring, but Bill wants to see more.

Yeah I think we all want to see more I think when collaboration occurs we all benefit but of course laboratories have their own protocols and ideas on that.

Someone asking if we can get a copy of the slides uh and i address that afterwards um but there's a there's a statement in here from one of the rudys that your presentation is high content good presentation rudy uh rudy says so good work ben thank you for this this is this that's Rudy Hoffman saying that oh okay yes um I was curious about what Rudy Gray thought about how well I covered his work well you'll you'll be able to speak with Rudy both Rudys when we're done here in the zoom if you'll stay with us all right let me see if there's any other questions I'm looking on YouTube live stream I don't see any and are there any other

Well, here's one that just came in. Is there any cryonics tech focused on the rejuvenation instead of preservation? Any that you're aware of?

You mean reanimation?

Yes. That's what the question is.

In a way, this research is also, you know, we're trying to rejuvenate these rabbit kidneys, you know, we're trying to cool them and bring them, make them fully functional and transplantable. So that's, that's, that addresses that issue, I think.

Okay and let's see if there's anything else in here i think i've got all the questions is there anyone else that has a question for ben

# Closing Remarks

Well for having a zoom meeting they can do it spontaneously yes please let me invite everyone who's in zoom to stay with us in zoom so that you can be in the after party and uh i want to thank you again ben for a great presentation let me let me finish this up here and then we go into our after party

So if you interested if anyone interested in cryonics and you don't have the information you need, please contact me. I'm happy to put you in touch with the different organizations and get you whatever information I can on cryonics.

If you're watching this recording, know that you can reach me at neil at churchofperpetuallife.org. so you can email me right through the website at perpetual.life and you can send me your questions or comments there and I'd like to remind you that at the end of this month of the last Thursday of January that's January 29th we will have our regular meeting of the month and want to thank Ben again for the idea of celebrating Bedford Day in this manner and for leading all of our Bedford days thank you all for coming and we'll see you

Yeah also for the person who asked about the slides remember that this meeting is being recorded and they can review the meeting at their at their own pleasure by going to the church of perpetual life website that's right that's right just go to the perpetual life website at the top of the site you'll see youtube live stream click on that and and you'll be able to see the recorded version of this event.

Thank you, Ben. And you can proceed at your own rate. You don't have to go listen to my slow talking. You can go to the sections of interest to you. So it's better than, anyway.

Yes, that's true. Very good. All right. So we'll close this out then. Thank you very much, everybody.

# Takeaways?

- **SST Protocol Optimization**: Standby/Stabilization/Transport minimizes ischemia via S-mix metric (cumulative ischemic exposure); tricks include circulating water under/around patient for faster external cooling, liquid ventilation for rapid internal cooling without surgery (targeting ~7°C core in 1h, ~22°C in 20min), and local proximity to facilities over fly-in/deploy.

- **Cryoprotectant (CPA) Vitrification**: Balance CPA concentration to suppress ice nucleation (effective below -120°C, none at -140°C) while mitigating toxicity; M22 (Alcor) vs. VM-1 (CI/Tomorrow Bio) trade-offs in cost, stability (VM-1 excels in dry ice), perfusion, and ultrastructure preservation; new low-toxicity CPAs from 21CM enable rabbit kidney vitrification/rewarming/transplant.

- **Rewarming Challenges**: Devitrification risk from nuclei formed during cooldown peaks on rewarm; radiofrequency (RF, Brian Wowk) or alternating magnetic fields (nanoparticles, Llinás) achieve ultra-rapid rates (cortex/medulla differential addressed), reducing required CPA doses.

- **Ischemia and Preservation Metrics**: Zero S-mix ideal; EEG retention > ultrastructure as viability proxy; ITS (-90°C to -120°C) avoids cracking; micro-CT for real-time perfusion monitoring in rats.

- **Collaboration Imperative**: Objective CPA comparisons (A&B/21CM), shared protocols (RBS/SA with CI/Alcor/Tomorrow Bio) accelerate peer-reviewed breakthroughs (e.g., Coles brain connectome refutation in PLOS One).
