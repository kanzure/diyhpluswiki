Cell-specific targeting refers to the ability to target different cells mainly based on sampling the nano-objects exposed on the surface of cell membranes. This is slightly different from [[cell-specific expression]] which refers to the concept of using internal state of the cell to determine if a genetic program should be executed or not, or [[lineage tracing]] related things.

Both cell-specific targeting and cell-specific expression can be combined. For example, cell-specific targeting could trigger a [[cell therapy]] that delivers a [[gene therapy|gene-therapy]] and that gene therapy might also check for cell-specificty using internal mRNAs or other indicators before executing another genetic program.

See also [[morphogenesis]] where cell surface sampling is also important, for cadherins and notch or integrins etc. One difference is that programmable morphogenesis also uses cell-cell signaling for patterning and decision making, not just surface-surface sampling and recognition.

synNotch (synthetic Notch) is an engineered, modular cell-cell communication pathway that lets researchers program custom "if-then" behaviors in living cells based on cell recognition and activation of an internal response. synNotch is a ligand-gated transcriptional switch that turns cell-cell contact into any desired genetic output.

# intracellular sensors

check this [ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01680-5) for a section on synthetic intracellular receptors including:

* Cal-Light (calcium- and light-gated switch)
* CHOMP (circuits of hacked orthogonal modular protease)
* intrabody sensor
* RASER (rewiring of aberrant signaling to effector release)
* LOCKR (latching orthogonal cage-key proteins)
* COMET (composable mammalian elements of transcription)
* POST (phosphoregulated orthogonal signal transduction)

This is obviously off-topic for cell-cell targeting.

# TODO

* consider surface-bound antibodies?
* synNotch receptors for programmable antigen targeting
* multi-receptor logic gating
* ADR
* B cell repetoire (BDR) engineering
* optogenetic activation of cell-cell surface receptors ?
* optogenetic control of expression of surface-bound antigen or ligand?
* orthogonal interleukin systems (e.g., synthetic IL-2 variants)
* multiplexing with synNotch or SNIPR
* recombination of individual sensor elements or triggers or something? how to generate a toolkit of reconfigurable elements for many cell-cell targets?

One could imagine fusing SpyTag presented on one cell, SpyCatcher fused to receptor extracellular domain on another, with downstream signal transduction. Need to engineer membrane anchoring, perhaps proteolytic release or dimerization leading to transcription.

what about using conformational change in integrin when under tension to trigger downstream signals? or other cadherins, adherins, integrins etc.

exosome surface display of custom scFv / nanobody, and cells that detect exosomes via uptake or just receptor binding

have surfaces expressing complementary binding tags (e.g. zipper domains, SynCAM‐zipper) to bring cells into proximity.

Chemical or non-protein binding modules (aptamers, DNA, peptides) anchored to cell surfaces or display, as sensors. For example the synthetic membrane anchor Ts-pHLIP-Pr is one piece of this direction. [ACS Publications](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c10903?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
