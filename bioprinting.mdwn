# Blood vessel donation into 3d bioprinting constructs

## Microvascular fragment (MVF) micro-grafts

Microvascular fragment (MVF) “micro-grafts” printed or embedded into constructs.

* **Bioprinted dermis + human adipose MVFs (HaMVFs):** MVFs co-printed in GelMA/HAMA/fibrinogen rapidly reassemble into perfusable microvessels and boost healing. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37876343/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Analytical Science Journals](https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bit.28588?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Islets + adipose MVFs in 3D collagen (in vitro):** MVFs vascularize pancreatic islets inside hydrogel—useful template for pairing explanted microvessels with dense tissues. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8301445/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Whole-vessel explants

Whole-vessel explants grafted into gels to vascularize in vitro bioprinted/engineered tissues

* **Explant-driven sprouting to make chimeric vasculature:** mouse aorta/vena cava/AV-bundle explants embedded in fibrin sprout into cell-laden hydrogels, forming hybrid (explant + human EC) networks; notes on anti-fibrinolytic (aprotinin) and stiffness effects.

* **General background on explant/microfluidic vascularization on-chip:** recent platforms vascularize organoids/tissues via induced angiogenesis and perfusion (useful when you want a pre-made bed to “graft” your printed tissue onto). [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45710-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10456-022-09842-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Macro-vessel graft

Use a macro-vessel graft (native or TEVG) as a suturable “header” that angiogenically feeds your printed tissue

* **Suturable TEVG → angiogenesis into tissue construct (2024):** demonstrates a **hierarchically vascularized & suturable** construct by letting a TEVG sprout into the engineered tissue. Great template for using a graft as inlet/outlet + angiogenic source. [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706124005798?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **TEVG with micro-channel bed (“AngioTube”) concept:** macro-conduit surrounded by a micro-channel array to promote perfusion and outgrowth into bulk tissue. [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706122002951?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## AV-loop / pedicle transplants to pre-vascularize printed constructs

* **AV-loop method (protocol & reviews):** create an artery–vein loop inside a chamber that contains your scaffold/bioprinted matrix; loop vascularizes the construct, which can later be transplanted with its own vascular axis. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5226146/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Karger](https://karger.com/esr/article/59/3-4/286/128671/The-Arteriovenous-Loop-Engineering-of-Axially?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46571-4.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Inline anastomosis of printed hydrogels (large animal):** 3D-printed hydrogel modules connected in-line to a porcine AV shunt to assess patency/flow [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2021.629313/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Perfusion hardware

Perfusion hardware that lets you hook actual vessels into your printed constructs either in vitro/ex vivo.

* **Arteriovenous perfusion bioreactor (in vitro):** modular system that recreates arterial and venous conditions for multi-scale vascular networks—handy when you want physiologic shear on graft-fed constructs. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/11/11/1147?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Ex vivo native-vessel culture in 3D-printed bioreactors:** protocols and devices for pulsatile culture of porcine/human arteries (Luer-friendly), which you can plumb to a printed scaffold loop. [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2022.864580/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [JoVE](https://app.jove.com/t/65465/ex-vivo-perfusion-culture-large-blood-vessels-3d-printed?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Pragmatics

* **Matrix choice & proteolysis control:** With artery/vein explants in fibrin, expect explant-induced fibrinolysis; aprotinin stabilized gels and improved sprouting windows in vitro. Stiffness also correlates with sprout distance—tune G′ accordingly. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10874928/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **“Micro-graft” density:** MVFs can be printed/embedded at high volume fractions; these their own perivascular support cells, speeding inosculation versus EC-only inks. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11939927/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Perfusion plumbing:** pair a **suturable TEVG/native-vessel segment** as an inlet/outlet with a small-volume loop; the AV-style perfusion scheme helps maintain physiologic pressure gradients. [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706124005798?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/11/11/1147?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Path to in vivo:** If translation is the goal, the **AV-loop chamber** is the most mature route to take a prevascularized (even bioprinted) construct into an implant with immediate flow via microanastomosis. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5226146/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46571-4.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
