**Animal uplifting**, animal cognitive enhancement, or sapientization, is a speculative transhumanist concept involving the deliberate elevation of non-human animals to advanced levels of intelligence with the idea of approaching or exceeding human baselines through biotechnological interventions.

potential techniques include but are not limited to:

* genetic engineering
* embryo engineering and [[in vitro fertilization]] related methods
* [[neurosurgery]]
* [[nootropics]] including neuropharmacological intervention, microbial nootropics, etc.
* [[brain-computer interfaces]] (cybernetics or cyborgization)

parrots are pretty good at human language. pets such as dogs and cats can be trained to communicate with button-press talking systems. Great apes can learn sign language. Monkeys have obtained jobs in the human economy, such as picking coconuts or other labor.
