# Synthetic morphogenesis

This page pertains to synthetic morphogenesis, synthetic-patterning circuits, morphogenetic engineering, programmable tissue patterning, programmable tissue morphology, genetic morphogenesis, and synthetic developmental biology.

Synthetic morphogenesis treats the shape, size, organization and fate of multicellular tissues as a programmable trait. By combining synthetic gene circuits, cell-cell signaling, mechanical cues and self-organization rules, engineering can be used to direct populations of living cells (from bacteria to mammalian stem cells) to autonomously build predetermined 3d structures and patterns thereby mimicking or surpassing normal embryonic or other development.

[Harnessing synthetic biology to engineer organoids and tissues](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11684341/) this has a good overview of prospective techniques for programmable developmental biology, cell-cell adhesion, multi-state genetic circuits to control morphology, optogenetic chimeric receptors, synNotch receptor system, synthetic diffusive morphogen system using a synthetic receptor "such as MESA", synthetic cell-cell adhesion molecules, multi-fate synthetic circuits, juxtacrine signaling, diffusible morphogens, differential cell adhesion, etc.

Still, we are not yet to the point of encoding large-scale multi-tyoe network topology even in a probabilistic encoding kinda way. In the future we ought to be able to encode entire 3d anatomies into a genome and have it reliably expressed as a volumetric phenotype.

# MultiFate via zinc finger transcription factors

"MultiFate uses engineered zinc finger transcription factors that self-activate their own transcription as homodimers and mutually inhibit one another when they form heterodimers. Their homo- or heterodimerization can be controlled by small molecules. Thus, by expressing only three types of such synthetic transcription factors, the cell lines can generate seven distinct cell states. Of note, this MultiFate system can, in principle, be combined with other synthetic circuits mentioned above, which enables cells to make a series of fate choices in multicellular systems as in normal tissue formation. When applying these tools to organoids, it is important to consider their tunability. How much signal is required to induce a response, and what will be the intensity or duration of the response?"
