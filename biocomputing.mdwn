Biocomputing refers to the development of [[physical learning systems]] using biological matter. This usually refers to cells and even more often to neurons, like in vitro neurons in tissue culture or cortical [[organoids]] and other organoids. However biocomputing can also be achieved through other kinds of cells including microbes like bacteria or fungi.
