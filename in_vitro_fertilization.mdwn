This will be a disorganized mess for a bit.

* in vitro fertilization
* embryo, sperm, oocyte/egg cryopreservation

"Hatched chicks with chimeric brains containing cells from both the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) and the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) have been produced by transplantation of various regions of the neural tube at the 8- to 15- somite stage. The positions of host and donor cells relative to graft boundaries observed throughout embryonic development and after hatching implicated both radial and tangential cell movements in brain morphogenesis. In addition, transplants containing the entire quail mesencephalon and diencephalon resulted in the transfer of certain aspects of species-typical crowing behavior."
