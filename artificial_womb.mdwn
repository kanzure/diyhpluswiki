So far the human uterus is the best vehicle for gestation. Therefore, an ex vivo human uterus would make the most sense as an artificial womb.


* ex vivo human uterus for long-term gestation, except we do not have any human organs that survive for more than about a week on perfusion...
* pig surrogacy via humanized pig uterus or pig blastocyst complementation of human cells that generate a human uterus inside of the new pig
* artificial womb via placenta cauterization and transfer into an incubator
* whole embryo culture techniques
* The weird thing the logs about how to convert a human egg into an egg that survives outside of the human body. Hatched humans? human yolk? Oviparous human eggs (~5-6kg football-sized with 2.5kg yolk, porous CaCO3 shell for O2 diffusion).
* The market for artificial wombs is somewhat small due to the existence of human surrogacy as a commercial service.
* Much of the interest in artificial wombs has actually been towards better neonatal incubators. This is different from an artificial uterus. 
* Ex vivo perfusion of any human organ let alone a human uterus has not exceeded 30 days so far.....
* placenta on a chip studies?
* forearm ovarian grafts for easier ultrasound-guided aspiration

Placenta challenges: Bleedy capillary bed; cauterize/cannulate umbilical but poor capillary perfusion. Prefer natural placenta over synthetic. ... placenta is a giant bleeding mess ... cannulate the umbilical cord but i'm not sure you will get the right perfusion.

uterine transposition live birth has been achieved in human.
