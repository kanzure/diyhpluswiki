# About this wiki

This is a wiki for open source hardware, do-it-yourself biohacking and practical transhumanism. The engineering teams behind this wiki can be found in the [[hplusroadmap]] IRC channel ([logs](http://gnusha.org/logs/)). Projects are self-funded by the group.

    git clone git://diyhpl.us/diyhpluswiki.git

Note to push changes you must push with your registered account:

    git push username@diyhpl.us:/srv/git/diyhpluswiki.git master

You can make this easier by updating the remotes:

    git remote set-url origin username@diyhpl.us:/srv/git/diyhpluswiki.git

Now "git push" should work without debilitating complaint.
