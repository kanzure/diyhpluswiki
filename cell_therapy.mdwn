# Cell therapy

Cell therapy surpasses [[gene therapy]] in precision and durability of therapeutic effect because it engineers autologous (or, increasingly, allogeneic but universally edited) cells ex vivo.

Our ability to engineer large synthetic programs into cells ex vivo is vastly greater than our ability to deliver large multi-kb upgrades through in vivo gene therapy. In addition, you can get quality assurance and validation while in vitro before insertion into human. Or, alternatively, you can also test in vitro, in vivo in animals, etc.

The other advantage of cell therapy over gene therapy is with respect to the immune system. Cell therapy enjoys a friendlier immune profile than gene therapy because it can be engineered ex vivo to cloak or actively modulate immune reactivity (like through HLA matching, universal “off-the-shelf” hypo-immunogenic edits, or other techniques) before the patient ever sees the cells. By contrast, gene therapies must be delivered in vivo by viral (or other nano-object) vectors that instantly present foreign capsid or trans-gene products to the host immune system, which then neutralizes the payload and creates pre-existing or induced immunity that blocks re-dosing. Moreover, any transduced cell becomes a perpetual antigen source, risking cytotoxic T-cell and antibody responses against the corrected tissue, while administrated cells can be equipped with suicide switches or transient immune privilege, allowing tight control of immune engagement.

If an engineered cell needs to secrete a compound for which the immune system is not tolerant, then several things can be done (regardless of whether you are using cell therapy or gene therapy). One of the simplest ways to avoid raising an immune response to a secreted protein is to re-design the molecule so that it is no longer immunologically "foreign".

1. Molecular humanization: turn a non-human protein into one that looks as if it had always been part of the human proteome as far as the immune system is concerned. For example, "complementarity-determing regions" CDR loop grafting, surface-residues humanization (mutate the positions of the solvent-exposed residues unrelated to the active site such that you instead use the most common residues found in orthologous human proteins, thereby erasing potentially immunogenic epitopes), or "humaneering" algorithms where you align hundreds of human homologues and build a consensus human sequence for the most exposed loops and exchange non-conservative positions to this humaneered pattern, keeping the enzyme or receptor core untouched.

2. Various camouflage strategies where the immune system is made to believe that the new protein is something that it already tolerates. For example, fusion to an extremely abundant, immunologically inert scaffold such as human serum albumin (HSA). For examply, glycan shielding by introducing new N-linked glycosylation sites onto the exposed, potentially immunogenic faces of the protein, and we hope that those bulky, endogenous sugar trees block direct B-cell receptor contact and reduce proteasomal processing into antigenic peptides. For example, self-marker conjugation where the protein is fused to the Fc region of any human IgG subclass such that the Fc portion signals "self".

3. Molecular chimeras: very similar to "humanization" as above, but you specifically take an already-tolerated human protein domain (such as a ubiquitous helicase) and embed the cataylic residues of (for example) a minimal Cas nickase inside a region that normally has a different function. 

A practical gene-therapy pipeline would often combine these layers: first humanize the drug molecule as far as possible, then fuse the remainder to an innocuous carrier such as albumin or Fc, and finally use codon-optimized, tissue-specific expression cassettes to drop the overall neo-antigen load still further.

immunosuppression is another option that seems to work.

Some other things that can be done:

1. Immunoprivileged sequestration: express the therapeutic protein within an immune-privileged anatomical compartment such as the  anterior chamber of the eye. The physical barrier lowers T-cell priming and antibody neutralization while still allowing efflux of the secreted molecule into the systemic circulation at therapeutically relevant concentrations.

2. Local immune “stealth” engineering: Use CRISPR or rAAV knock-in to delete or silence MHC-I/II genes in the graft (B2M*, CIITA*), or co-express PD-L1, CD47, CD200, and HLA-G together with “don’t-eat-me” proteins. Add ectopic B7-H4, VISTA, IL-10, TGF-β, and IDO to create a tolerogenic cytokine niche right at the implantation site.

3. Secretion of “self” variants: Re-encode the therapeutic peptide into the genomic context of a naturally circulating human protein that circulates at high abundance (e.g., albumin, transferrin, or IgG Fc domains). Fusion to the native sequence keeps plasma antigen load low and prevents recognition as non-self.

4. Codelivery of local tolerogens: Engineer cells to co-secrete PD-L1-Fc, HLA-E/Fc, or CD200L-Fc fusion proteins, or release biodegradable micro-particles containing rapamycin, dexamethasone, or anti-CD3 scFv to convert the pericellular milieu into an active site of immune tolerance rather than inflammation.

5. Suicide-switch insurance: Embed inducible drug-responsive (iCasp9, truncated EGFR antibody recognition) or small-molecule regulated (HCV-NS3, FKBP-casp9) suicide mechanisms into the cell product so that if robust rejection is detected despite the above strategies, the graft can be promptly ablated with minimal systemic toxicity.

6. Transient expression via mRNA delivered by electroporation or otherwise: Limit the duration of exposure to the antigenic construct by using non-integrating payloads that decay over days-to-weeks—long enough for acute therapeutic benefit, short enough to avert chronic immune recognition.

7. Antigen-camouflage glyco-shielding: Glyco-engineer the cells to overexpress sialyl-transferases (ST3G4/6Gal1) and CD47 so their glycocalyx hides or degrades nascent neo-peptides, and simultaneously blocks the uptake by antigen-presenting cells.

8. Tolerogenic vaccination before grafting: Administer a “prime-and-tolerize” protocol where the patient receives tolerogenic dendritic cells prepared with the therapeutic protein (or key peptide epitopes) plus rapamycin and IL-10 in order to drive antigen-specific Treg expansion prior to cell implantation.

9. HLA-matched “off-the-shelf” universal lines: For allogeneic secreting cells, derive clonal hypo-immunogenic master banks using CRISPR-mediated triple KO (B2M, CIITA, CD155) plus transgenic over-expression of NK-inhibitory ligands (HLA-E, non-polymorphic β2m fusion, CMV UL-18 domain). This minimizes both CD8+ T- and NK-mediated rejection even when robust antigen is released in the long term.

These strategies are modular and combinations might be able to achieve layered immunity control while still permitting sustained systemic secretion of the therapeutic compound.

## various autologous stem cell therapy methods

## xenotransplantation, transplants, implants

Cellular implants are another method of delivering gene therapy. Of particular interest is that this method does not really require DNA/mRNA uptake by other cells. You insert new cells and then those new cells do a new job. Ideally these are immunosilent or immunocompetent cells.

### Direct MHC Disruption

Knocking out MHC class I and/or II expression in therapeutic cells reduces visibility to CD8⁺ T cells. Since MHC-I isn't essential for cell survival, many cancers naturally employ this as an immune-evasion tactic [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001620305530?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.636568/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Conversely, this tactic risks triggering natural killer (NK) cells, which attack cells lacking MHC-I—termed “missing self.”

### Stealth Transgenes

“Stealth” transgene strategies target both MHC class I and II to evade host immune detection. Early studies show promise in engineered T cells successfully avoiding cellular immune responses [Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy](https://jitc.bmj.com/content/12/5/e008417?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### Viral-Strategy Mimicry

Many viruses have evolved to inhibit MHC antigen presentation by:

* Blocking peptide entry via TAP inhibitors
* Retaining MHC-I in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi apparatus
* Directing MHC for degradation via ER-associated pathways [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1540159/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Therapeutic cells imght be able to mimic immune stealth we see in some viruses by co-opting these mechanisms with targeted gene edits, like by modifying antigen-processing pathways.

## Immune-Modulating Receptor Engineering

### Alloimmune Defense Receptor (ADR)

In alloimmune defense receptor (ADR) strategies, therapeutic T cells are empowered to eliminate activated host T and NK cells while sparing resting immune cells. By targeting the avictation marker 4‑1BB, ADR-expressing T cells resist rejection and persist in vivo when co-expressed with CAR constructs [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7854790/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Epigenetic & Transcriptional Modulation

### Reactivating MHC or Downregulating Detection Pathways*

* Tumors often downregulate MHC via epigenetic suppression or via downregulating key transcription factors like NLRC5 [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.844866/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* CRISPR–dCas9 epigenetic tools can potentially be used to fine-tune gene expression, such as either dampening antigen presentation in therapeutic cells or, in broader contexts, restoring it during immunotherapy [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2329050121000759?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Emerging strategies for immmune system evasion

* **Partial MHC Retention + Non-classical HLA**: Completely removing classical MHC risks NK detection. A nuanced approach might knock down classical MHC while expressing non-classical or inhibitory HLA molecules to suppress NK activity, akin to tumor evasion tactics [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoediting?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **NK Checkpoint Modulation**: Therapeutic cells might express ligands that bind NK inhibitory receptors (like HLA-E to interact with KIRs), or modulate KIR pathways to escape NK-mediated killing [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02280-1?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Local Immune Suppression**: Engineering cells to secrete immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., TGF-β) selectively could locally dampen the host immune response while minimizing systemic impact.
* **Mapping Virus-Derived Peptides**: Incorporating viral peptide sequences that interfere with MHC pathways—as viruses do—for controlled immune evasion, though highly speculative and risky.
* **Combining ADR and MHC Editing**: Pairing MHC disruption with ADR-type systems might create "immune-evasive but immune-persistent" cells that both hide and defend.

Multi-layered approach for immune evasion or resistance:

1. **Hide** — Edit out or modify MHC molecules.
2. **Defend** — Engineer immune-targeting receptors like ADR.
3. **Suppress** — Modulate local or systemic immunity.
