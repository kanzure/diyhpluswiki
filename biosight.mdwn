# Optogenetics for biosight

Optogenetic neuron stimulation is a widely used technique in neuroscience, both in vitro and in vivo in freely behaving or freely moving animals. See also [[optogenetic axon guidance]] for specific techniques to design and pattern neuronal networks. See [[optogenetics]] for a high-level overview.

Of particular interest is **high resolution** spatial light modulation to transmit information to neurons or cells. Retinal explants or retinal organoids are interesting options because they have extremely high density photoreceptors, rods, cones, and retinal ganglion cells leading into the axons bundle usually called the optic nerve. Each human eye has approximately 1.2 million axons in the optic nerve, and about 100 million sensors. There are some eagles with approximately 5 million retinal ganglion cells and corresponding axons in the optic nerve per eye.

A deep problem of neurosicence is that microelectrode arrays have not significantly scaled in size or density. Many millions of electrodes are needed for simultaneous read and write. Optogenetics or retinas can get us to 100 million or more 'electrodes' (sensors), and these sensors can be individually addressable depending on their geometry or spacing compared to our ability to deliver addressable input via spatial light modulation at the same acuity. Likewise, optogenetics can also deliver significantly high resolution high bandwidth output via motor neurons as actuators or even simple optogenetic genetically encoded optical voltage indicators monitored by light microscopy or fluorescence microscopy.

"[Arrays of microscopic organic LEDs for high-resolution optogenetics](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4928914/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)" - ".. the arrays comprise 230,000 OLED pixels across an area of ~20 mm^2 ... To harness the high resolution of the OLED microarrays and the unrestricted simultaneous switching of pixels for pattern generation, cells have to be in close proximity to the OLEDs; ideally, the separation is less than the pixel size. To enable close contact while still protecting the water-sensitive OLED materials from the aqueous cell culture environment, OLED arrays were protected by a thin-film encapsulation barrier consisting of alternating layers of Al2O3 and an organic Barix polymer (three layers of Al2O3 and two layers of polymer; total thickness, 1.5 μm; Vitex Systems)... " oh also it's lens-free.

You can keep a **native (ex vivo) retina** alive in culture and even **preserve the optic-nerve head (ONH) or a short optic-nerve stump**; whole-eye perfusion models also exist. You can (i) culture native retina/ONH (optic nerve head) ex vivo, or (ii) build **retina→thalamus→cortex “assembloids”** entirely from organoids so RGC axons grow **out of** the retina (rather than bringing in an intact optic nerve).

## What’s been done already

* **Adult retina organotypic/explant culture (rodent, human, NHP).** Robust protocols maintain layered structure and RGCs for days–weeks; many labs culture **whole-mount retina** on membranes for physiology, imaging, AAV testing, etc. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9962025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **ONH/optic-nerve–preserving explants (in vitro).** Groups report organotypic cultures that explicitly **leave the ONH and a short optic-nerve segment intact**, improving RGC integrity and enabling ONH studies. (Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, 2023 abstract). [IOVS](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2789488&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Whole-eye / ocular perfusion ex vivo.** Mouse, porcine, and human **whole-globe perfusion** preparations preserve **retinal cytoarchitecture** and light responses for hours–day-scale windows (good for physiology/tox studies). [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10637262/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [BioMed Central](https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-024-01892-y?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Ex vivo retina physiology with intact tissue.** Ex vivo ERG on **intact retinas** (animal/donor) and **compound action potential** recordings from freshly dissected **optic nerves** are standard. [Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences](https://ophthalmology.wustl.edu/app/uploads/2017/05/2015JoVE-6-doi-10.3791-52855.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11218842/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Retina→brain organoid “assembloids” (all from stem cells).** A landmark model fused **retinal, thalamic (LGN-like), and cortical organoids**; **RGC axons extended** deep into the thalamic/cortical targets and RGC survival improved in the long term. This is the cleanest demonstration of retinofugal projections **in vitro**, but it starts from organoids (no native optic nerve). [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8452489/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Retina co-culture/target specificity models.** Earlier work co-cultured RGCs or retinal tissue with thalamic/tectal targets to test **targeting and synaptogenesis** (again, generally **new outgrowth**, not plugging in an intact adult optic nerve). [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5484165/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## What hasn’t (apparently) been shown yet

* A **naturally developed retina + long, intact optic nerve** transplanted **into an organoid system** and kept **functionally connected through that native nerve**. I couldn’t find a paper demonstrating stable long-term culture of the **entire adult mammalian optic nerve** in vitro *and* functional synaptic drive into a brain organoid via that nerve.

  The obstacles are well-known: **adult RGC axons don’t spontaneously regrow**; long myelinated CNS axons undergo **Wallerian degeneration** without perfusion and glial support; and **guidance/lamination cues** are needed to land in the correct thalamic layers. That’s why ex vivo retina models usually keep only a **short ONH/nerve stump** (for days–weeks), and why retinofugal **assembloids** rely on **new axonal extension** from RGCs. [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.599948/full)

## Feasible near-term bridge experiments (if you want to try this)

* **Start with ONH-preserving retina explants**, placed close to a **thalamic organoid** or brain slice in a micro-device that bridges the gap (micro-tunnels/ECM strands). Add **pro-regeneration cues** (PTEN/SOCS3 modulation, CNTF, c-Myc) shown to enable adult RGC axon growth in optic-nerve injury models; monitor outgrowth with anterograde tracers and GEVI/GCaMP in the target. [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.599948/full)
* Alternatively, **whole-eye perfusion** coupled to an adjacent organoid chamber (shared medium/perfusion) could extend viability while you attempt **short-range neurite bridging** from the ONH stump; but expect days, not weeks, of stable function unless you move to an assembloid strategy. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10637262/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [BioMed Central](https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-024-01892-y?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* If you mainly want a **“natty retina front-end”**, the most tractable path today is: **native retina (ex vivo) for phototransduction + DMD patterned stimulation**, and readout/processing in vitro via **direct RGC recordings** or **optical voltage imaging**—**without** insisting on using the native long optic nerve as the link. The “wired” link can be newly grown axons into a **thalamic organoid**, as demonstrated in the assembloid literature. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8452489/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Bottom line:** keeping a **native retina + short ONH** alive ex vivo is routine, **whole-eye perfusion** is feasible short-term, and **retina→brain connections** are best modeled today with **organoid assembloids** where **RGCs regrow** into the targets. A **true transplant of a native retina with its long optic nerve into organoids** hasn’t been shown yet, but you could prototype a **hybrid system** that preserves the native retina while encouraging **new RGC outgrowth** into thalamic/cortical organoids—combining the biological front-end you want with a tractable wiring strategy supported by current literature.
